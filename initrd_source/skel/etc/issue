 Your autoinstall has failed.  You can use the shell prompt to try and see 
 what happened.  Go back and re-read the FAQ-HOWTO to see if your problem 
 is described there.  You have read the FAQ-HOWTO, right? ;)

 If you absolutely cannot figure it out, you can sign up for the

 someone else has experienced this very same thing.  List information 
 is avaliable at http://systemimager.org/.

 If you find the answer and it's not in the FAQ-HOWTO, please send it in
 with all relevant details to <brian@thefinleys.com>.  If your submission 
 gets added to the FAQ-HOWTO, you will be given appropriate credit.
