              This is the SystemImager autoinstall system

 Your autoinstall has failed.  You can use the shell prompt to try and see 
 what happened.  Go back and re-read the documentation to see if your 
 problem is described there.  You have read the documentation, right? ;)

 If you absolutely cannot figure it out, you can sign up for the 
 SystemImager email list and post your issue.  There's a good chance 
 someone else has experienced this very same thing.  List information 
 is avaliable at http://systemimager.org/.

 If you find the answer and it's not in the documentation, please send it 
 in with all relevant details to <brian@systemimager.org>.  If your 
 submission gets added to the documentation, you will be given 
 appropriate credit.  -Brian
