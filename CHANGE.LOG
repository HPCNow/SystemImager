VA SystemImager-1.4.0 2000.xx.xx
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

install 
-------
o Now works with /etc/rc.d/init.d/ or /etc/init.d.
o The imageserver now runs rsync as a daemon from an init script.  This
  is configured automatically at install time.

installclient
-------------
o Don't overwrite systemimager.exclude if it already exists.  Thanks to
  Wesley Smith <wessmith@engr.sgi.com>.

getimage
--------
o now leaves it's mark -> "/etc/systemimager/IMAGE_LAST_SYNCED_TO"
o added the "replicant" option to the -ip-assignment option.
o -help and -version now exit with a status of 0.
o Added support for LABEL=/partition/label format in /etc/fstab.  This
  format is used in new (not upgrades) RedHat 7 installations.
o Improper usage statements no longer include the entire output from 
  the --help option.  In earlier versions this would often run the 
  usage correction statement off the screen.  Still provides a reminder
  to "-help".
o Now autodetects whether prepareclient left the partition data behind
  as "-explicit-geometry" or as megabytes.  If using megabytes, 
  getimage creates the autoinstall script in such a way that client 
  disks don't have to have the same geometry.  They can even be 
  significantly different sizes.  They can easily be much larger than 
  the original master client disks and can even be smaller...  (within 
  reason -- depends on specific partition scheme)
o Now uses the --numeric-ids rsync option.
o Fixed a harmless bug that made nasty output when blank lines were in
  the golden clients /etc/fstab file.  The fix was to tell getimage to
  skip blank lines in the /etc/fstab file.  

systemimager.exclude 
--------------------
o added additional exclusions for Debian.  Thanks to Wichert Akkerman
  for sending these in.

local.cfg
---------
o Now uses IMAGESERVER instead of DHCPSIADDR.  Of course, it is 
  backwards compatible so as not to completely confuse you. ;)

rsyncd.conf
-----------
o Change back to using one log file: /var/log/systemimager

afterburner
-----------
o Test for inetd and SIGHUP as is appropriate.
o Test for xinetd and SIGUSR1 as is appropriate.  Thanks to Dann 
  Frazier <daniel_frazier@hp.com> for pointing out that xinetd only 
  does a state dump with a SIGHUP and requres a SIGUSR1 to do a soft 
  reconfigure.
o Now works with /etc/rc.d/init.d/ or /etc/init.d.

updateclient
------------
o now leaves it's mark -> "/etc/systemimager/IMAGE_LAST_SYNCED_TO"
  noting the image the client was last synced to.
o added the -configure-from DEVICE option.  Only used with -autoinstall.
  Stores the network configuration for DEVICE in the /local.cfg file so
  that the same settings will be used during the autoinstall process.
o -help and -version now exit with a status of 0.
o Now uses the --numeric-ids rsync option.  Thanks to all who submitted
  info on this one.  This closes bug #123339.

goldenclient
------------
o Changed phraseology from "master client" to "golden client"

installclient
-------------
o /etc/systemimager/ directory is now properly created.  This closes bug
  #123337.  Thanks to James Oakley <joakley@solutioninc.com>.

prepareclient
-------------
o -help and -version now exit with a status of 0.
o Offers to add "127.0.0.1 $hostname" to /etc/hosts.
o Now defaults to using megabytes to store partition information.  Can
  be told to leave explicit partitioning information for getimage with
  the -explicit-geometry option.
o What was I thinking in v1.3.0 with the -no-rsyncd option?!?  Don't try
  this, folks.  It would record your imageserver's partition information
  as if it were the client's.

makedhcpstatic
--------------
o Automatically send a HUP signal to dhcpd (if running) to make it
  re-read the freshly modified config file.

makedhcpserver
--------------
o Now supports specification of an imageserver that is a different
  machine from the dhcp server.
o Added patches from John Goebel <jgoebel@valinux.com> to allow for
  other non-systemimager specific advanced options!

autoinstallclient
-----------------
o added support for 3c905 
o added support for 3c59x
o added support for pcnet32
o added support for Alteon AceNIC/3Com 3C985/NetGear GA620 Gigabit
o added support for 3ware Hardware ATA-RAID (EXPERIMENTAL)
o Kernel and patches:
  o http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/linux-2.2.17.tar.bz2
  o ftp://ftp.lugoj.org/pub/reiserfs/devlinux.com/pub/namesys/linux-2.2.17-reiserfs-3.5.28-patch.gz
  o http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mingo/raid-patches/raid-2.2.17-A0
o Smallerized.  More stuff done by BusyBox.
o Now using hardlinks for BusyBox.  Thanks for this suggestion go 
  to: Rob Latham <rlatham@plogic.com>.
o Added mawk.  Funky and easily breakable sed stuff can now be done
  with mawk.
o Changed to dhclient.  dhclient allows us to try all interfaces for
  DHCP.  This will solve some instances where a system would boot the 
  autoinstall media off the network, but then couldn't get an IP 
  address for the running OS.  dhclient also allows us to specify the 
  imageserver as seperate from the dhcp server.
o Bug fix:  Was using POSIX [[:blank:]] in sed statement to find and 
  change spaces and tabs to single spaces.  Sed version changed and no 
  longer behaved properly.  Spaces work fine with the v1.3.0 client but
  tabs will give you errors.
o Enforce that the client sleeps 35s before trying to use the network.  
  Even if using local.cfg.

autoinstall scripts 
-------------------
o Added the -L option to sfdisk.  Recommended by Matthew Marlowe 
  <mmarlowe@jalan.com>.
o Fixed a bug where autoinstall of clients with reiserfs root partitions
  fails.  The -notail option must be used, otherwise lilo will complain
  about a hole in a mapfile and not make the disk bootable.  Thanks to 
  Matthew Marlowe <mmarlowe@jalan.com> for submitting this bug.
o Turn on swap space after initializing.  In the past we didn't use the
  swap space at all.  Go ahead and use it to help out in low memory 
  situations.
o Now uses the --numeric-ids rsync option.
o Fixed the bit where egrep is used to test for mounted filesystems 
  (indicating a running machine that shouldn't be touched).  grep is now
  used and no error messages should be seen.

makeautoinstallcd
-----------------
o -help and -version now exit with a status of 0.

makeautoinstalldiskette
-----------------------
o -help and -version now exit with a status of 0.
o Test for either superformat or fdformat.  Use superformat if both exist.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
VA SystemImager-1.3.0 2000.10.04
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- autoinstall kernel -- Patched with:
                        - http://people.redhat.com/mingo/raid-patches/raid-2.2.17-A0
                        - http://www.tux.org/pub/devel/reiserfs/linux-2.2.17-reiserfs-3.5.25-patch.gz
- prepareclient -- <<<<< Don't use this feature to update    >>>>>
                   <<<<< your master scripts.  I must have   >>>>>
                   <<<<< been up *really* late the night I   >>>>>
                   <<<<< did this.  See comments for v1.4.0. >>>>>
                   Added the -n or -no-rsyncd option.  This allows
                   you to run prepareclient from a chrooted image
                   and then run getimage with the -s option to
                   update your master autoinstall script.
- autoinstall media -- Added support for software RAID.
- getimage -- Added support for software RAID.
- getimage -- Fixed a bug where filesystem creation and mounting was 
              done based on the order of entries in the fstab file.
              If /boot came before /, for example, then the resultant
              autoinstall script would unsuccessfully try to mount 
              /boot first.  Mount points are now sorted.  Thanks to
              Dale Harris <rodmur@valinux.com> for finding this one.
- getimage -- Fixed a bug where fstab files containing tabs or with
              spaces at the beginning of a line might not be parsed
              properly.  This could potentially result in an 
              improperly created autoinstall script.

VA SystemImager-1.2 2000.09.25
- makedist -- Only used by me really (Brian).  Now automatically sets the
              version number in each of the appropriate files.
- prepareclient -- No longer messes with /etc/rsyncd.conf.  Now uses a
                   temporary configuration file: /tmp/rsyncd.conf and
                   references it like this:
                     rsync --daemon --config=/tmp/rsyncd.conf
- afterburner -- modified to add [tftpboot] section to existing 
                 rsyncd.conf file.
- updateclient -- Now looks for systemimager.exclude in /etc/systemimager/.
- updateclient -- Figures out root device from /etc/fstab and appends
                  LAST_ROOT=device to lilo.conf entry when -autoinstall is
                  issued.  This allows for placing a local.cfg file in the 
                  root filesystem prior to rebooting after running 
                  updateclient -autoinstall.
- updateclient -- added the -autoinstall option.  Courtesy of
                  Alan Lambert <alambert@epicrealm.com>.  Allows you to 
                  tell any machine that is currently running to autoinstall 
                  itself the next time you reboot.  *Very* cool idea!  No 
                  mucking about with removeable media or that tricky PXE 
                  stuff for remote re-installs.
- makedhcpstatic -- added support for restarting dhcp daemon.
- addclients -- images are now presented in chronological order from
                oldest to newest.  newest is now the default that is 
                presented.
- addclients -- made the descriptions more clear and broke it up into 3 
                sections.
- rsyncd.conf -- now has entry for /tftpboot and the /var/log/systemimager
                 entry is added on a per image basis.
- autoinstalldiskette -- now uses a 1.44M floppy!
                         - faster creation
                         - faster booting
                         - fewer floppy failures
- autoinstallclient -- now uses rsync v2.4.6
- autoinstallclient -- now uses smaller libraries, allowing for larger 
                       kernels and more utilities!
- autoinstallclient -- support for use *without* DHCP!  See the FAQ for 
                       more info.
- autoinstallclient -- kernel includes support for software RAID and for
                       reiserfs.
- autoinstallclient -- added support for post install options of beeping,
                       shutdown, or reboot.
- autoinstallclient -- can now be used *without* DHCP.
- autoinstallclient -- added support for ext3.
- autoinstallclient -- added support for reiserfs.
- autoinstallclient -- added beep utility.
- autoinstallclient -- added mkraid and raidstart utilities.
- autoinstallclient -- added mkreiserfs.
- autoinstallclient -- added Wes Smith's patch to sedding for the HOSTNAME.
- autoinstallclient -- added some diagnostics.
- autoinstallclient -- added ifconfig and route utilities.
- autoinstallclient -- using rsync again for everything except network
                       boot installs.
- getimage -- you can now specify the path to the image directory with
              the -directory option.  Suggested by Wesley Smith 
              <wessmith@engr.sgi.com>.
- getimage -- added the -server option to allow copying an image from one
              imageserver to another.  Suggestion and example code
              contributed by Phil Champon <pchampon@valueweb.net>.
- getimage -- modified the way getimage deals with filesystems to make it 
              much easier to add new filesystems to the supported list.
- getimage -- added support for post install options of beeping,
              shutdown, or reboot.
- getimage -- added support for ext3 and reiserfs.
- getimage -- changed the mke2fs options to the conservative defaults.
              Hopefully soon we will be able to detect existing settings and 
              re-create those by partition.

VA SystemImager-1.1 2000.05.26
- updateclient -- Fixed a bug.  root --> / was not becoming the default 
  if the -directory option was not used and updateclient was exiting 
  quietly.  Just an if/then/else issue.
- syslinux RPM -- Bug in the syslinux RPM prevented proper creation of 
  bootable CD image with makeautoinstallcd.  This is fixed as of 
  syslinux-1.48-2.i386.rpm.  (Note: this was not a bug in syslinux, just
  a bug in the packaging)
- FAQ-HOWTO updates and fixes.
- makeautoinstallcd -- fixed a bug where the output file was not created
  properly unless an absolute path was given.  Now works with an absolute
  path, a relative path, or just a filename (to be placed in the current
  working directory).
- prepareclient -- (also part of the va-systemimager-client RPM)
  Implemented a delay between killing a running rsync daemon and starting
  up the fresh one.
- prepareclient -- now tests for hostname in /etc/hosts for rsync.
- autoinstallcd.iso -- autoinstallcd ISO image put up on the download 
  site. (3 Meg)
- prepareclient -- gave it a real usage statement.  Behavior is 
  no longer to traipse upon the network with tftp, but to use the 
  utilities on the client system.  Options are -help, -version, and -quiet
- va-systemimager-client RPM -- now you *must* run prepareclient after
  installing the client RPM.  This is so that you don't unwittingly have
  an rsync daemon running sharing things you don't want shared.
- added support for debian.  Let me know how it goes.

VA SystemImager-1.0 2000.05.02
- The name changed ever so slightly ;)
- Lots of little things -- bug fixes and what not.  Ease of use stuff.
- added the "makeautoinstallcd" command.  This allows you to create a 
  bootable 3 Meg iso9660 image that you can burn to a CD.
- addclients -- If you give it new hostnames for a range of existing 
  IP addresses, it now replaces the existing hostnames instead of 
  ignoring them.

SystemImager-0.24beta 2000.03.09
- makedhcpstatic -- Modified to try /var/state/dhcp/dhcpd.leases, then
  /etc/dhcpd.leases, and as a last resort /var/log/messages.
- autoinstall system -- The autoinstalldiskette is no longer based on
  Tom's Root Boot.  It is now a miniature distribution of my own.  It
  boots using syslinux.  This also allows us to use the same kernel and
  root filesystem for both diskette booting and network booting via
  pxelinux (part of syslinux).
- rsyncd.conf -- added "chroot = no".  
  Brian Luethke <luethke@msr.epm.ornl.gov> pointed out that if a users
  UID/GID is different on a client (from the imageserver) when doing an 
  "updateimage", the client ends up with a file owned by a user that 
  doesn't exist.  By using "chroot = no", rsync is able to translate UIDs
  to the appropriate user on the client system.  If a user with the same
  name does not exist on the client, then it still gets a UID that belongs
  to no user.  Sigh...
- systemimager.exclude -- added /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*
- FAQ-HOWTO -- updated the FAQ and combined it and the HOWTO together.
- INSTALL -- got rid of this document and added it's contents to the README.
  Cleaning up clutter is always good.
- install -- allows a -q, -quiet, or --quiet option.
- install -- you can now run install from any fully qualified or relative path.
- install -- relocated /systemimager/images to /var/spool/systemimager/images.
  In the future, the installer will present you with a choice for the _real_
  location.
- install -- no longer using a tarball within a tarball.
- install -- added more statements to tell you what it's doing.
- install -- added some additional error checking.
- install -- took out the bit that copied /etc/hosts to /systemimager/etc/.
- install -- nothing gets installed to /systemimager.
- install -- now puts documentation in /usr/doc/systemimager-$version.
- install -- now puts binaries in /usr/sbin/.
- install -- no longer asks if you want to create an autoinstalldiskette.
  This was confusing and caused people to think they had to create a diskette
  at that point, or they had missed their chance.
- rsyncd.conf -- added *.deb, *.rpm, and *.dbf to the don't compress directive.
- rsyncd.conf -- removed the [etc] and [installstuff] blocks.  These small 
  files will now be transferred via tftp.  tftp is now necessary anyway in 
  order to support network booting.
- rsyncd.conf -- now logs transactions to /var/log/systemimager.  This can
  be used to track the progress of clients autoinstalling or updateimage(ing).
- addclients -- now asks you for the number of the first machine and the
  number of the last machine (instead of "how many machines").
- addclients -- now presents you with a list of avaliable images and tests
  to be sure that specified image exists.  (suggestion courtesy of Stephen
  Greene <sgreene@valinux.com>.
- addclients -- changed to create host entries in /etc/hosts only.  No more
  messing about with the non-intuitive (dual) location of
  /systemimager/etc/hosts.
- getimage -- has been "perlized" by Wesley Smith <wessmith@engr.sgi.com>.
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- NISDOMAIN is now added to 
  /etc/sysconfig/network (for both dhcp and static) and NETWORK and 
  DOMAINNAME are added to static.  
  (patch sent in by Michael P. McLeod <mmcleod@bcm.tmc.edu>).
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- HOSTNAME is only added to 
  /etc/sysconfig/network when using static IP addresses.  This way, the host 
  gets it's hostname via DHCP along with it's IP address -- and they match!  
  Even if they change!  This means you can change the hostname by simply 
  changing the IP address assigned by dhcpd (based on MAC addres).
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- pointed new images to 
  /var/spool/systemimager/images/$image and reflected this in the
  /etc/rsyncd.conf file.

SystemImager-0.23 2000.02.14
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- only $HOSTNAME is written to 
  /etc/HOSTNAME and /etc/sysconfig/network instead of $HOSTNAME.$DOMAINNAME
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- fixed a bug where filesystems were
  not created and mounted in the appropriate order.  (bug submitted by 
  Tanmoy Bhattacharya <tanmoy@lanl.gov>)
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- took out the bit at the end that
  tries to make noise and ends up writing "\a\a\a\a\a\a\a"
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- Ian McLeod <ian@valinux.com> 
  observed compression saturating CPU utilization on an imageserver when 
  installing only 8 clients simultaneously.  Turned compression off during 
  autoinstall, and observed moderate CPU utilization whilst installing 21 
  clients simultaneously.  Now I need to go to Gigabit Ethernet on the 
  imageserver to relieve the network bottleneck.
- getimage and therefore $image.master -- added an example of how to customize 
  the sfdisk statements.  If you are installing the same image to clients with
  disks that are physically different in any way from the client you got the 
  image from, you should customize your sfdisk statements according to the 
  example you will find in your $image.master script after you do your getimage.

SystemImager-0.22 1999.12.29 (I'm getting Altitude sickness -- no more
                              declaring the elevation.  Well, I'm not really
                              sick, not that way, anyway, but it's not really 
                              accurate.  I didn't do all of the work on v0.21
                              at 655 feet, for example.  Oh, well ;)
- Ari, sorry I haven't incorporated your changes yet.  Haven't been able to 
  review them thoroughly and test them.  But they look good and will get in 
  soon.
- added 5 more seconds to each of the two sleep statements on the 
  autoinstalldiskette.
- fixed a bug in the autoinstalldiskette (found by Susan Coghlan <smc@lanl.gov>
  and separately found by Robert Saft <zardoz@valinux.com> and 
  Ted Arden <ted@valinux.com>).  Both new and old mkswap commands were on the
  diskette, but the new one was in /tmp/ ?  Moved the new (large swap capable)
  mkswap command to /usr/bin on the diskette and got rid of the old one.
- fixed a bug in the autoinstalldiskette (found by Susan Coghlan <smc@lanl.gov>)
  that had to do with finding the nodes host name based on it's IP address.  If
  the node had an IP address of 1.1.1.24, but 1.1.1.244 came earlier in the 
  /systemimager/etc/hosts file, it would match the 1.1.1.244 address and assume
  it was the corresponding host.
- do chown afterwards, so that files in tarball don't have to be owned by root
- autoinstalldiskette -- umount all non-floppy filesystems and make noise when 
  done, in addition to dropping eth0, but don't halt (so that noise continues)

SystemImager-0.21 1999.12.07 at 655 feet (Dallas, Tx)
- install and prepareclient -- bux fix submitted by Susan Coghlan 
  <smc@acl.lanl.gov>: dots (.) and dashes (-) in function names apparently 
  break with bash2.  Also recommended a change in the way prepareclient 
  deals with /etc/systemimager.exclude.
- addclient -- changed some of the interactive defaults as indicated by [x],
  and added some error checking.
- install -- bug in the verbage -- fixed by Ari Jort.
- FAQ -- updated by Ari Jort.

SystemImager-0.20 1999.11.22 at 655 feet (final touches made in Dallas, Tx)
                                 (but coded at several different altitudes)
- overall theme for changes -- scripts for everything!!!  You should be
  ready to autoinstall your first client in (basically) three steps:
  - run install and answer all it's questions and follow it's instructions
  - run prepareclient on the "master" client
  - run getimage on the imageserver
  Now you should be ready to boot your first autoinstall client off the
  autoinstalldiskette.
- updateimage -- Major overhaul.  Now written in perl.  Just try it.
- makedhcpstatic -- decided to continue using /var/log/messages as
  the dhcpd.leases file can be found in many different places and
  for some reason, /var/log/messages is always in the same place ;).
- renamed /systemimager/installscripts to /systemimager/installstuff
- moved /systemimager/clientstuff into /systemimager/installstuff
- changed all instances where "systemimager" was used to refer to the
  image server with "imageserver".  It just makes more literary sense.
- makedhcpserver -- created it!  This script will ask you appropriate 
  questions and create a starter dhcpd.conf file for you *and* include 
  the information necessary for autoinstalldiskette clients to find the 
  imageserver.
- prepareclient -- now pulls client scripts, client bin, and etc stuff
  onto "master" client _before_ getting image.  Places updateimage in 
  /usr/bin on client.
- $imagename.master -- cleaned up the static IP section (this will be
  automated later) and added an ifconfig eth0 down so that the client
  will no longer respond to pings after it has halted (so you can tell
  when a headless client is finished autoinstalling).
- addclients -- created it!  This script will create the symbolic links
  necessary for your autoinstall clients to autoinstall.
- autoinstalldiskette -- added the aic7xxx module (an Adaptec SCSI module).
  This means support for the VA Linux Systems FullOn servers.  I also 
  discovered that with certain ethernet switches it takes about 30 seconds,
  after the interface comes alive, before they will transmit data on that
  port.  It seems that the dhcp request would go out during that time
  period and that the dhcp client would give up.  The autoinstalldiskette
  now brings up the ethernet interface with a bogus address of 127.0.0.2
  which makes the interface live (as far as the switch is concerned).  
  The autoinstalldiskette then sleeps until after the switch starts 
  transmitting, and then issues it's dhcp request which is serviced 
  almost immediately.
- other stuff what I can't remember...

SystemImager-0.19 1999.10.14 at 655 feet (Dallas, Tx)
- autoinstalldiskette -- made it truely generic again.  no longer necessary 
  to modify the diskette image during install.  this means that the server
  system no longer requires ram disk capability!  And it makes the install
  floppy more flexible -- you don't have to modify it if you change the IP
  address of the server.  This is done by adding the IP address of the 
  imageserver as the last name server entry in dhcpd.conf.  If it 
  happens to be running a nameserver, great!  If not, the entry will be 
  ignored.  The client then takes this last name server entry and assumes 
  it to be the imageserver.
- prepareclient -- no longer customized at install time.  this script is
  also now generic.  it simply asks for the imageserver's ip address when
  it is run.
- install -- modified appropriately to deal with the above changes.
- install -- added some error checking to the yes/no questions.
- prepareclient -- added some error checking to the yes/no questions.
- autoinstalldiskette -- added some error checking so that even if certain
  network related errors occur, the system will not hang and you can still
  login to the client to see what's up. 
- VERSION -- started keeping separate versions for the autoinstall diskette
  and SystemImager (so's that I don't have to modify the image of the 
  "generic" diskette just to change the release number.
- getimage -- take "# pounded out lines" in $image/etc/fstab into 
  consideration.

SystemImager-0.18 1999.10.05 at 34,000 feet (Albuquerque, NM to Dallas, TX)
- getimage -- added lines to the /systemimager/installscripts/$image.master
  script that can be uncommented if clients will use static IPs after the
  install.
- makedhcpstatic -- created it.  No more mucking about trying to punch in
  gobs of mac addresses.  Simply populate /systemimager/etc/hosts with all
  the relevant client and server IP addresses, specify a dynamic range in
  your dhcpd.conf file, and image your clients with the autoinstall 
  diskette in the order you want the IP addresses assigned.  After
  booting your systems, you can run this script to make the static entries
  for you!  This script reverse resolves IP addresses to hostnames via the 
  /etc/hosts file on the server and uses hostnames instead of IP addresses 
  in the dhcpd.conf file.  This way, you can change a hosts IP address by 
  simply changing the entry in /etc/hosts on the image server.
- Perl -- started writing server-side scripts in Perl.  Existing server 
  side scripts will be converted to Perl in time.  It just got too messy 
  in Bourne. ;)
- modified the autoinstall diskette so that:
  - it only has a 5 second delay during boot
  - it uses extended VGA and doesn't ask your opinion
  - it shows it's name as "SystemImager-autoinstalldiskette-$version"

SystemImager-0.17 1999.10.05 at 655 feet (Dallas, Tx)
- getimage -- changed rsync options so that it actually *gets* all
  of the filesystems now that we're no longer assuming only one
  filesystem.
- getimage -- chmod +x prepareclient script after modifying
- getimage -- no longer bother unmounting before halting in $image.master
- VERSION -- started including this file

SystemImager-0.16 1999.10.04 at 655 feet (Dallas, Tx)
- getimage -- overwrite $image.master every time.   
- getimage -- create $image.master script with the ability to 
  partition *each disk* *exactly* like on the master client
  by pulling data left behind by "prepareclient".
- prepareclient -- rsync over a static sfdisk and get *exact*
  partition scheme for *each* disk (as per /proc/partitions).
  store this information in /etc/partitionschemes/$drivename
  for retrieval by "getimage" once image is on the imageserver.

SystemImager-0.15 1999.09.19 at 655 feet (Dallas, Tx)
- getimage -- use rsync to get mount information via /etc/mtab
  instead of asking if network filesystems are mounted
  and exclude all non-ext2 filesystems from the get.  Perhaps
  we'll become more flexible and pull other appropriate filesystems
  in the future.

SystemImager-0.14 1999.09.19 at 655 feet (Dallas, Tx)
- modify getimage to assume only swap and root, and therefore to use 
  the -x option in rsync to constrain to one filesystem.
- modify getimage to ask questions and do some discovery
- modify getimage to create $imagename.master in installscripts
- get rid of SystemImager.default.sh
- add warning about floppy drives to makemeadiskette/install.s

SystemImager-0.13 1999.09.15 at 33,000 feet (Albuquerque, NM to Dallas, TX)
- maybe I hadn't finished the install script...  added a kill -HUP for inetd
- also added a kill -HUP for inetd to prepareclient
- modified prepareclient to create rsyncd.conf if it didn't exist at all

SystemImager-0.12 1999.09.15 at 655 feet (Dallas, TX)
- finished install script -- for installing SystemImager on the image server
- install script now prompts you to create your first autoinstall diskette
- wrote prepareclient -- for preparing a client to have it's image taken
- renamed /systemimager/installstuff to /systemimager/installscripts
- added installscripts entry to 
  /systemimager/serverstuff/etc/rsyncd.conf.starterfile 
- updated /systemimager/clientstuff/bin/updateimage to not present 
  "installscripts" when doing a listing.
- finished modifications to autoinstall diskette to take advantage of using 
  rsync to grab the initial install script

SystemImager-0.11 1999.09.14 at 35,000 feet (Newark, NJ to Dallas, TX)
- changed mode of initial image install so that no tftp is necessary.
  now using rsync to get client specific install script.  
  (Idea courtesy of "Ari Jort" <ajort@valinux.com>)
- added install script -- for installing SystemImager on the image server

SystemImager-0.10 1999.09.12 at 32,000 feet (Dallas, TX to New York, NY)
- added comments to dhcpd.conf.systemimager.example file
- added tftp to /usr/bin with man page in /usr/man
- tftp is now used to pull down scripts using the more flexible scheme 
  described below.
- changed mode of initial image install so that no nfs is involved and also to 
  allow greater flexibility/manageability geared towards client 
  customization/different images.

SystemImager-0.9 1999.09.07 at swamp level (Princeton, NJ)
- changed the name from TheLamp to SystemImager
- changed script names/directories/variables, etc. as appropriate
- expanded the exclude list in the getimage script

TheLamp-0.6
- get /etc/resolv.conf from dhcpcd -- no more static configuration on diskette

- get get DNS domain name from /etc/resolv.conf
- added sfdisk to /bin with man page in /usr/man
- removed the static sfdisk from /thelamp/installstuff
- added rsync to /bin with man page in /usr/man
- removed the static rsync from /thelamp/installstuff
