post 3.2 stuff
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o System Installation Suite HOWTO for linuxdoc.org
o HOWTO Change the Filesystem of an Existing Machine
o consider putting our CREDITS file into the Linux kernel's CREDITS file's 
  format
o update mkdhcpstatic to check DNS in addition to /etc/hosts to reverse resolve
  host names
o pcmcia utils in boel_binaries_tarball
o multiple small function related libraries
o consider making mkautoinstalldiskette and mkautoinstallcd not require root 
    when using -out-file.
o Hey all,

  First off, are we going to try to support local.cfg files on CDs in 3.0?  I
  thought that was on the list (especially with the fact that many boxes are
  floppyless at the moment, and cd-rw are pretty cheap).  It would require
  adding isofs to the kernel, and trying to mount it.

  I also have another request for passing variables, via kernel appends.  On
  the big boxen (iSeries and zSeries) that have virtual linuxes running on top
  of a base OS, there is no floppy boot or such.  You just say "Boot this
  kernel, that ramdisk, and here is your kernel append line."  The kernel
  append options are available from userspace on a running machine via
  /proc/cmdline.  Hence we could even possibly use this in the cd boot case
  instead of isofs support as well.  The autoinstall script would just parse
  off all the cmdline options that were a=b, and add them to the config
  variables.  With this trick you could also theoretically set local.cfg like
  parameters during pxeboot as well.

  Ok, value seems to be 80 bytes.  It is set by a define in
  include/linux/elfcore.h
  
  #define ELF_PRARGSZ     (80)    /* Number of chars for args */

  so hopefully we could just up it and things wouldn't completely fall appart.

  What do you all think?

        -Sean

o Move most of -help output to man pages.
o Standardized format for man pages and for -help output.
o add full -h text to man page for mkautoinstalldiskette.
o Consider rsync's BATCH MODE
o add lvm support
o parallelize si_install (is mktemp available on all distros)
  (consider using install-N-sub)




Other things to consider
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o Modify updateclient -autoinstall to use whatever kernel/initrd combo it 
  finds if it only finds one, but to present the user with a choice if it 
  finds more than one flavor.

o make local.cfg work on CD

o NAMESERVER= option for local.cfg

o lsimage on client gives error messages when run without options.
  Give better output at least.

o updateclient -> SERVER_LAST_SYNCED_TO
o autoinstallscript -> SERVER_LAST_SYNCED_TO

o LABEL= with md devices

o exclude files on server and on client

o create rmclient

o have rmimage,mvimage,cpimage tell the user what it's doing if($verbose)
  Removing rsync entry...done!
  Removing image...done!
  etc...

o test $IMAGENAME stuff
  o IMAGENAME in local.cfg
  o dhcp23.sh
  o dhcp.master

o mkbootserver
  Make a little friendlier, perhaps use locate to produce a list of files 
  so users don't have to go looking for them.  Also, perhaps move to 
  perl?
