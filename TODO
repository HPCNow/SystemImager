2) need to identify more modules that are not necessary for a typical
   install, and add those to the etc/UYOK.modules_to_exclude file.

4) need to remove discover and discover-data bits, and all references to
   them.  this functionality now provided by udev + hotplug

   (postponed -- don't think having discover there hurts anything, and
    it may help -BEF-)

5) consider using modprobe instead of insmod for re-loading modules

    (non-critical, just something to contemplate -BEF-)

6) Add a kernel-devel tree package, like those that ship with RedHat, 
   Ubuntu, etc. There's just enough data to build boot-kernel modules 
   against, but nothing else. 
   
   Ie: kernel-headers. (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

7) A boel_binaries_template, just like the initrd, so additional
   drivers can be dropped into /lib/modules/<kernel_ver>/. 
   (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

8) Standard kernel to have only modular drivers for:
   - all network devices
   - all storage devices
   (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

9) Include mkrecoveryISO in the standard release.

10) si_mkbootmedia.  Status?

11) si_mkautoinstallcd -- deal with fs sizing more gracefully

12) si_mvimage bug ($file)

13) improved tftpbooting architecture

    ln -s /usr/share/systemimager/boot /tftpboot
    cp -a pxelinux.bin pxelinux.cfg/ /tftpboot
    cp -a elilo.efi /tftpboot
    etc.

    si_mkclientnetboot
        - generates a boot file for each client that looks like below,
          and includes a nice net-boot message for the client's console
          that explains their net-boot kernel choices:

            DEFAULT standard

            #
            # Uncomment next line to send pxelinux boot prompt over
            # serial port 0.

            # (57600, 9600, etc.)
            #

            # first serial port
            # (ttyS0) as a console in addition to your monitor (tty0).

            # size of your tmpfs
            # filesystem.  About 100MB larger than your image size
            # should suffice.
            #
            # Other tmpfs mount options are also supported.  See the FAQ
            # for details.
            #tmpfs_size=800M
