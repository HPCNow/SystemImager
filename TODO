---------------------------------
Possibilities for future versions
---------------------------------

Suggested by Todd Sargent <tsargent@pioneertechnology.net>
----------------------------------------------------------
o web interface (gui) that allows all image server operations as well as:
  o schedule clients to be updated or re-autoinstalled at a later date
    o produce a master schedule file, available from the webserver,
      that clients pull down via a cron job.  parse the file to determine
      the details of what they're supposed to do (if anything).
  o provide for reporting of clients that have completed their autoinstalls.

George Perry <perryg@elcsci.com>
--------------------------------
o bootable recovery CD that self-installs from image stored on same CD

<brian@thefinleys.com>
----------------------
o web gui
o X gui
o Jose_AP_Celestino.ida.prepareclient.patch to make systemimager work
  properly with Smart Array cards.
o getimage - put exclude/include stuff on imageserver by image
  /tftpboot/systemimager/$image.updateclient.include
  /tftpboot/systemimager/$image.updateclient.exclude
o updateclient - local /etc/systemimager/systemimager.exclude or include
  take precedence over include and exclude on imageserver.
o updateclient - include/exclude pulled to temporary files.
o prepareclient - no longer puts /etc/systemimager/systemimager.exclude on
  client.
o check for the presence of a BIOS file written by BIOSwriter. If 
  found, then at the tail end of a client's image pull, it runs 
  BIOSwriter to write the file.
o deal with LABEL=UUID as well as LABEL=mount_point
o next release (1.5.x), make the -imageserver option go away
  in getimage.
o getimage -- exclude option
o if local.cfg and dhcp fails, have client ask for manual input
o redirect to serial port:
  - manual change to syslinux.cfg
  - maybe an append parameter if necessary
  - detect if serial is wanted by having rcS look for variable in
    - $image.master
    - local.cfg
o add -exclude option to getimage
o incorporate ssh
  1) client generates and gives it's key to imageserver prior to pulling down image?
  2) imageserver adds client's key to it's .ssh/authorized_keys file
  3) client can rsync -e ssh in.
o incorporate casper (multicast by Aaron Hillegass <aaron@bignerdranch.com>)
o getimage -- blink option
o getimage -- eject option
o contemplate using wget to pull stuff?
o contemplate using khttpd or tux or similar to show autoinstall client status
o command to put mac addresses/host names into 
  /etc/dhcpd.conf by using broadcast pings, the arp 
  table, and /etc/hosts or dns.
o store certain parameters in /etc/systemimager/systemimager.conf as 
  IMAGESDIRECTORY="/var/spool/systemimager/images"
o section of HOWTO that helps Kickstart users transition to SystemImager.
o redirect syslog messages from autoinstall clients to $imagserver
o addclients -- accept command line input such as --image $imagename
o addclients -- re-cycle through each question if answer is ""
o have getimage question what should be excluded in future when updateimage 
  is run.  /tmp/* and /home/* should be recommended as a starting place.

Ian McLeod <ian@valinux.com>
----------------------------
o autoinstall clients report to imageserver "I'm up"
o ability to blink led, floppy light, eject cdrom, etc. on 
  autoinstallclient to identify the machine prior to initiating the 
  autoinstall.
o option to initiate an autoinstall from the client or from the server.
o option to assign permanent IP address/hostname from the server after
  an autoinstall client has booted and checked in.
o ability to adapt to the hardware
  - client chooses section from <imagename>.master based on disk type
    (master script contains sections for hd, sd, and rd)


Miscellaneous and Possibilities
-------------------------------
o commandline-ize the rest of the commands
o /etc/systemimager/systemimager.conf file to hold things like domain name, nis domain, etc.
o support for dual boot systems (Linux/Windows with FAT/HPFS/NTFS)
o makedhcpserver -- autodiscover and calculate more information 
  (including if system has more than one network interface).
o makedhcpserver -- automatically change line in /etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcpd for you
o curses wrapper around the whole thing?
o updateclient - log what was updated and or deleted?
o makedhcpstatic -- allow for -f "filename" option to specify dhcpd.leases file.
