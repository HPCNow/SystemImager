Version 1.4.0 specific:

<brian@thefinleys.com>
----------------------
- Deal with tftp support (for network booting) on xinetd systems.
  (this is actually something to deal with in the tftp-hpa package 
   install)

- Redo the website
- Make it clear that people should mail the list and not me.

- have deb package created
- modify RPM spec file to deal with:
  - configuration files
  - additional files
  - changed files
- label autoinstallcd.iso with v1.4.x (x is literal)
- start using bzip2

-----------------------
Version 1.4.1 specific:
-----------------------

<brian@thefinleys.com>
----------------------
o move mailing list over to sourceforge
o deal with UUID= in /etc/fstab

volunteers
----------
o lsimage
o rmimage
o mvimage

Wesley Smith <wessmith@cthulhu.engr.sgi.com>
--------------------------------------------
o devfs patch
o TurboLinux patch
o SuSe patch

Fred Gray <fegray@npl.uiuc.edu>
-------------------------------
o patch to allow exclude on golden 
  client during getimage.  ~/systemimager/contrib/patches.email

James Morton <jmorton@viata.com>
--------------------------------
o patch to have autoinstallclient
  ask user for settings. ~/systemimager/contrib/IOUs.email

---------------------------------
Possibilities for future versions
---------------------------------

George Perry <perryg@elcsci.com>
--------------------------------
o bootable recovery CD that self-installs from image stored on same CD

<brian@thefinleys.com>
----------------------
- use install to install files in install scripts
o Jose_AP_Celestino.ida.prepareclient.patch to make systemimager work
  properly with Smart Array cards.
o getimage - put exclude/include stuff on imageserver by image
  /tftpboot/systemimager/$image.updateclient.include
  /tftpboot/systemimager/$image.updateclient.exclude
- updateclient - local /etc/systemimager/systemimager.exclude or include
  take precedence over include and exclude on imageserver.
- updateclient - include/exclude pulled to temporary files.
- prepareclient - no longer puts /etc/systemimager/systemimager.exclude on
  client.
- series of slides as a HOW-TO
- series of slides for marketing
  - competitive analysis
    - kickstart
    - nothing at all
  - time saved
  - customer list
- check for the presence of a BIOS file written by BIOSwriter. If 
  found, then at the tail end of a client's image pull, it runs 
  BIOSwriter to write the file.
- deal with LABEL=UUID as well as LABEL=mount_point
- next minor release (1.5.x), make the -imageserver option go away
  in getimage.
- getimage -- exclude option
- if local.cfg and dhcp fails, have client ask for manual input
- redirect to serial port:
  - manual change to syslinux.cfg
  - maybe an append parameter if necessary
  - detect if serial is wanted by having rcS look for variable in
    - $image.master
    - local.cfg
- contemplate using MAKEDEV instead of having pre-existing device files
- fix network booting
- add -exclude option to getimage
- incorporate ssh
  1) client generates and gives it's key to imageserver prior to pulling down image?
  2) imageserver adds client's key to it's .ssh/authorized_keys file
  3) client can rsync -e ssh in.
- incorporate casper (multicast by Aaron Hillegass <aaron@bignerdranch.com>)
- put autoinstallmedia source into cvs
- identify mke2fs parameters -b, -i, and -m on the master client and replicate this on autoinstall clients
- getimage -- blink option
- getimage -- eject option
- makeautoinstalldiskette -- consider adding config file options?
- contemplate using wget to pull stuff?
- contemplate using khttpd to show autoinstall client status
- command to put mac addresses/host names into 
  /etc/dhcpd.conf by using broadcast pings, the arp 
  table, and /etc/hosts or dns.
- use something other than mtab for getting active ext2 filesystems?
- store certain parameters in /etc/systemimager/systemimager.conf as IMAGESDIRECTORY="/var/spool/systemimager/images"
- (part of the making of the tftp-hpa RPM) need to add proper tftp entry in /etc/inetd.conf 
   for tftp-hpa rpm.  If systemimager is installed with tftp-hpa, then systemimager's 
   afterburner will make the proper changes to /etc/inetd.conf.
- create man pages
- support for Caldera Open Linux
  - IF_LIST in /etc/sysconfig/network
- support for SuSE
- support for Slackware
- section of howto that helps Kickstart users transition to SystemImager.
- redirect syslog messages from autoinstall clients to $imagserver
- addclients -- accept command line input such as --image $imagename
- addclients -- re-cycle through each question if answer is ""
- have getimage question what should be excluded in future when updateimage 
  is run.  /tmp/* and /home/* should be recommended as a starting place.

Ian McLeod <ian@valinux.com>
- autoinstall clients report to imageserver "I'm up"
- ability to blink led, floppy light, eject cdrom, etc. on 
  autoinstallclient to identify the machine prior to initiating the 
  autoinstall.
- option to initiate an autoinstall from the client or from the server.
- option to assign permanent IP address/hostname from the server after
  an autoinstall client has booted and checked in.
- ability to adapt to the hardware
  - client chooses section from <imagename>.master based on disk type
    (master script contains sections for hd, sd, and rd)


Greg Pratt <gpratt@valinux.com>
-------------------------------
- Docbookization of the FAQ-HOWTO


Cameron Meadors <cmeadors@valinux.com>
and Roland Dreier <roland@valinux.com>
--------------------------------------
- write a new tftp daemon to do that special PXE thang, so that we no longer 
  have to use the buggy tftp-hpa daemon.


Miscellaneous and Possibilities
-------------------------------
- commandline-ize the rest of the commands
- support for imageserver specification in DHCP client (hack dhcpcd)
- modify systemimager.exclude to deal with debian network info
- /etc/systemimager.conf file to hold things like domain name, nis domain, etc.
- support for dual boot systems (Linux/Windows with FAT/HPFS/NTFS)
- makedhcpserver -- autodiscover and calculate more information 
  (including if system has more than one network interface).
- makedhcpserver -- automatically change line in /etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcpd for you
- add more error checking (always) :)
- curses wrapper around the whole thing?
- updateclient - log what was updated and or deleted?
- makedhcpstatic -- allow for -f "filename" option to specify dhcpd.leases file.
- mvimage command -- rename an image
- rmimage command -- remove an image
