Developer Guidelines
--------------------
o Current development branch is tagged "HEAD".  
  This is the default.  Most developers will use this.
o To work on the latest stable branch, download the development branch,
  then run "cvs -z3 update -r v1_4_1-beta".
o Only Brian Finley will modify CVS tags of any kind, such as for versioning 
  releases or creating development branches.
o Always get approval from Brian Finley prior to adding any new files or 
  directories to CVS.
o You may modify sections in the TODO file bearing your name.
o When you finish an item in your section of the TODO file:
  o Add an appropriate line to the CHANGE.LOG file before removing the 
    item from the TODO file (so we don't forget about keen changes 
    we've made).
  o Send an email to the <systemimager-devel> list announcing completion.
o Do not modify anyone elses section.
o Have fun!

Unclaimed Sub Projects
----------------------
o Documentation: how to migrate from KickStart to SystemImager.

Curtis Zinzilieta <czinzilieta@valinux.com>
-------------------------------------------
o updateclient:  Add a -no-update "Don't actually *do* the update, just 
  show me what would have been done." option.
o add the pushupdate script.

Brian Finley <brian@thefinleys.com>
-----------------------------------
o Create stable branch after release called 1.6.x-stable, or similar.
o Add Curtis Zinzilieta to CVS.
o prepareclient: make Y default at beginning
o updateclient:  Change -nolilo to -no-lilo, and hide nolilo in the background.
o remove depricated -master-client option in getimage
o deal with LABEL= and UUID= for any filesystem or device type
o chroot=yes in /etc/rsyncd.conf and test...
Change paths:
o images:        /var/lib/systemimager/images/
o all other SystemImager stuff (other than imageserver commands) will be
  stored in:            /var/lib/systemimager/
o web gui pages:        /var/lib/systemimager/web-gui/
o autoinstall kernels:  /var/lib/systemimager/`arch`/kernels/
o initial ram disks:    /var/lib/systemimager/`arch`/initial-ramdisks/
o autoinstall scripts:  /var/lib/systemimager/`arch`/scripts/
o autoinstall binaries: /var/lib/systemimager/`arch`/bin/
   (instead of the binary.architecture idea)
o PXE stuff will *not* be dealt with during install, but details will be
   documented in the howto.  Later, this configuration will be handled by
   the "pxeconfig" utility.  (I'm not sure I have your final buy in on
   this one)
o source for the kernel and initrd.gz and everything will be provided in
   a single package that has a master Makefile that will compile source
   provided, and copy over binaries that are just, well, copied over.
   (this also helps deal with the fact that it is sometimes difficult to
   get all the kernel patches to apply properly -- we can provide the
   actual kernel source tree with the patches pre-applied.)
o Modify binaries to use /var/lib/systemimager/ instead of /tftpboot/
o Austin Gonyou patch: Dual NIC Installs
o Jose_AP_Celestino.ida.prepareclient.patch to make systemimager work
  properly with Smart Array cards.  (must get a Smart Array card first)
o getimage -- exclude option
o getimage - put exclude/include stuff on imageserver by image
  /tftpboot/systemimager/$image.updateclient.include
  /tftpboot/systemimager/$image.updateclient.exclude
o updateclient - local /etc/systemimager/updateclient.exclude or include
  take precedence over include and exclude on imageserver.
o updateclient - include/exclude pulled to temporary files.
o prepareclient - no longer puts /etc/systemimager/systemimager.exclude on
  client.
o deal with LABEL=UUID as well as LABEL=mount_point
o next release (1.5.x), make the -imageserver option go away
  in getimage.
o if local.cfg and dhcp fails, have client ask for manual input
o add -exclude option to getimage
o incorporate ssh
o incorporate multicaster
o getimage -- blink option
o getimage -- eject option
o contemplate using wget to pull stuff?
o contemplate using khttpd or tux or similar to show autoinstall client status
o command to put mac addresses/host names into 
  /etc/dhcpd.conf by using broadcast pings, the arp 
  table, and /etc/hosts or dns.
o store certain parameters in /etc/systemimager/systemimager.conf as 
  IMAGESDIRECTORY="/var/spool/systemimager/images"
o section of HOWTO that helps Kickstart users transition to SystemImager.
o redirect syslog messages from autoinstall clients to $imagserver
o addclients -- accept command line input such as --image $imagename
o addclients -- re-cycle through each question if answer is ""
o have getimage question what should be excluded in future when updateimage 
  is run.  /tmp/* and /home/* should be recommended as a starting place.
o David Weenink <david.weenink@hum.uva.nl> suggests:
  o rename systemimager.exclude -> updateclient.local.exclude
  o include comments inside to indicate how the includes/excludes work
o change option-100 -> option-207
o add option-208 => "ssh_binaries_url"
o Bug [ #419641 ] Install script fails 
  (if there are spaces below the install directory)
o Notes regarding differences between v2 and v3 of dhcpd:
  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  The change from version 2 of ISC's dhcp server to version 3
  regarding the systemimager dhcpd configfile file is:

  With v2
  -------
  option option-100
  
  With v3
  -------
  option SImgsrv code 100 = text;
  option SImgsrv xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx;
  option dhcp-class-identifier --> vendor-class-identifier

  Explanation
  -----------
  The first line is the definition of the name "SImgsrv" using
  option 100. the second line uses the option name "SImgsrv" to
  assign the actual value, which is supposed to be an ip address in
  the case of systemimager 1.4.1 .
  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
o Modify rcS to do a ping loop instead of a 35s timeout.  When a ping
  succeeds, break out of the loop and proceed.
o Modify etc/issue in inird.gz

  o See email from michael@auctionwatch.com
  And if necessary, do the following too:
    o See email with Subject of: 
      Subject: serial redirect for autoinstalling systems remotely with systemimager
    o See linux/Documentation/serial-console.txt
    - manual change to syslinux.cfg

Dann Frazier <dannf@hazel.fc.hp.com>
------------------------------------
o replace install scripts with Makefile(s)
o have deb package created
o PXE booting ideas...
with pxe, you can specify what files to serve to a specific hardware
address.
you could have symbolic links that point to the SystemImager kernel &
initrd.gz for each node, with no default files.
you can then remove these links when you decide not to allow that
machine to PXE boot.
the machine will try to pxe boot, won't be able to find its kernel and
initrd.gz, and will boot from the harddrive.
a tool similar to addclients might be useful for this.

o web-gui that allows all image server operations as well as:
  o schedule clients to be updated or re-autoinstalled at a later date
    o produce a master schedule file, available from the webserver,
      that clients pull down via a cron job.  parse the file to determine
      the details of what they're supposed to do (if anything).  Create
      a command line utility for doing scheduling.
      o schedule:
        o -f filename
	o other options...
  o provide for reporting of clients that have completed their autoinstalls.
  o Add "Alias /systemimager/ /var/lib/systemimager/web-gui/" to srm.conf 
    in Apache.
o See the "GUI Layout" section in this document for details on the 
  proposed logical arrangement of screens, etc.

X Windows GUI
o Run from the imageserver sending the X display back to a sysadmins
  desktop.
o Distribution independent.  The two main distros to initially be
  concerned with are debian and redhat.  Minimal dependencies are
  preferred -- this will be run from a server which may not have lots of
  X and GUI stuff installed.
o The goal is to allow for all of the commands to be run by clicking
  buttons, filling in boxes, etc.
o See the "GUI Layout" section in this document for details on the 
  proposed logical arrangement of screens, etc.


GUI Layout (applies to Web GUI and X GUI)
-----------------------------------------
Main screen:
o Maybe have a SystemImager Wizard (is the term Wizard copyrighted?)
  that basically walks you through the steps in the "Step-by-Step 
  HOWTO":
  http://systemimager.org/manual/html/theactualstep-by-stephowto.html
o Also have buttons for each of the utilities labelled something like:
  o "Pull and Image from a Golden Client" (getimage)
  o "Add Client Autoinstall Information" (addclients)
  o "DHCP Server Configuration"
    o show me my existing config
    o create a new configuration file (makedhcpserver)
    o make existing DHCP leases static (makedhcpstatic)
  o Autoinstall clients
    o I want to re-install an existing system
      o connect to the existing system with ssh 
        (then autoinstall -a -s)
      o connect to the existing system with rlogin
        (then autoinstall -a -s)
    o I want to install systems with an autoinstall diskette
    o I want to install systems with an autoinstall CDROM

--------------------------------
o bootable recovery CD that self-installs from image stored on same CD

	Here's how I envision it working:
	o first you pull the image to the imageserver with 
	  "getimage -ip replicant" (This is a 1.4.0 feature.)
	o then you run the "makerecoverycd" command (This is the command you 
	  will create)

	Here's how the CD will work:
	1) one directory on the CD ( /imagename ) will hold the entire image.
	2) one directory on the CD ( /tftpboot/systemimager ) will hold a hosts
	   file that need only contain an entry for localhost and the machine to
	   be installed:

	<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
	127.0.0.1       localhost
	10.0.0.99       www3.systemimager.org www3
	<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

	3) Create a /local.cfg file on the CD.
	   the local.cfg file will specify localhost as the name of the
	   imageserver.  Other values will be filled in like normal.  It will
	   look like this:

	<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
	HOSTNAME=www3
	DOMAINNAME=systemimager.org
	DEVICE=eth0
	IPADDR=10.0.0.99
	NETMASK=255.255.255.0
	NETWORK=10.0.0.0
	BROADCAST=10.0.0.255
	GATEWAY=10.0.0.1
	GATEWAYDEV=eth0

	# IP address of the imageserver
	IMAGESERVER=127.0.0.1
	<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

	4) create an /rsyncd.conf file on the CD.  It will contain the entries:

	<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
	list = yes
	timeout = 600
	dont compress = *.gz *.tgz *.zip *.Z *.ZIP *.bz2 *.deb *.rpm *.dbf
	uid = root
	gid = root
	use chroot = no

	[tftpboot]
	  path = /tftpboot

	[imagename]
	    path = /imagename

	<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
		    

	5) modify the /etc/init.d/rcS script on the initrd.gz to do the
	   following:
	   o look for a /local.cfg file on CDs
	   o test to see if IMAGESERVER=127.0.0.1
	     o if it is, crank up rsync in daemon mode:
	       "rsync --daemon --config=/rsyncd.conf"
	   o then proceed as normal
	   ( I can take care of step 5 if you do the rest. )

	6) the client will then become it's own imageserver!  and we don't have
	   to modify any of the philosophy or methodology in the rest of the
	   package!


	So basically, if you write the command to create the CD as described
	above, I'll take care of modifying the initrd.gz.  However, you're
	welcome to tackle that too if you like.  Be sure that you are working
	from the latest version from CVS.  Instructions for downloading the CVS
	tree anonymously are here: http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=259

	Final tips:
	o Base the command on the "makeautoinstallcd" command.
	o test the size of the image to be sure it will fit on a CD before 
	  creating the iso image.
	o have fun!

	Feel free to let me know if you have any further questions.

	Cheers, -Brian




Ian McLeod <ian@valinux.com> (suggestions)
------------------------------------------
o autoinstall clients report to imageserver "I'm up"
o ability to blink led, floppy light, eject cdrom, etc. on 
  autoinstallclient to identify the machine prior to initiating the 
  autoinstall.
o option to initiate an autoinstall from the client or from the server.
o option to assign permanent IP address/hostname from the server after
  an autoinstall client has booted and checked in.
o ability to adapt to the hardware
  - client chooses section from <imagename>.master based on disk type
    (master script contains sections for hd, sd, and rd)


Miscellaneous and Possibilities
-------------------------------
o /etc/systemimager/systemimager.conf file to hold things like domain name, nis domain, etc.
o support for imaging dual boot systems (Linux/Windows with FAT/HPFS/NTFS)
  o see mondo (available on freshmeat)
o makedhcpserver -- autodiscover and calculate more information 
  (including if system has more than one network interface).
o makedhcpserver -- automatically change line in /etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcpd for you
o updateclient - log what was updated and or deleted?
o makedhcpstatic -- allow for -f "filename" option to specify dhcpd.leases file.
o check for the presence of a BIOS file written by BIOSwriter. If 
  found, then at the tail end of a client's image pull, it runs 
  BIOSwriter to write the file.
o pad hostnames with zeros option
