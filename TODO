4) need to remove discover and discover-data bits, and all references to
   them.  this functionality now provided by udev + hotplug

   (postponed -- don't think having discover there hurts anything, and
    it may help -BEF-)

5) consider using modprobe instead of insmod for re-loading modules

    (non-critical, just something to contemplate -BEF-)

6) Add a kernel-devel tree package, like those that ship with RedHat, 
   Ubuntu, etc. There's just enough data to build boot-kernel modules 
   against, but nothing else. 
   
   Ie: kernel-headers. (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

7) A boel_binaries_template, just like the initrd, so additional
   drivers can be dropped into /lib/modules/<kernel_ver>/. 
   (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

8) Standard kernel to have only modular drivers for:
   - all network devices
   - all storage devices
   (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

9) Include mkrecoveryISO in the standard release.

10) si_mkbootmedia.  Status?

11) si_mkautoinstallcd -- deal with fs sizing more gracefully

12) si_mvimage bug ($file)

13) improved tftpbooting architecture

    Location:
        ln -s /usr/share/systemimager/boot /tftpboot

    In that location:
        ia64/standard
            /elilo.efi (provided as part of ia64 standard boot package)
        i386/standard
            /pxelinux.bin (provided as part of i386 standard boot package)
            /pxelinux.cfg (provided as part of i386 standard boot package)
        x86_64/standard
              /pxelinux.bin (provided as part of x86_64 standard boot package)
              /pxelinux.cfg (provided as part of x86_64 standard boot package)
        etc...

    si_mkbootserver
        x- for now, just hardcode a softlink from /tftpboot ->
          /usr/share/systemimager/boot
        - later, re-write in perl and try to improve interaction

    si_mkclientnetboot
        For a host with a name of "my-host" with a mac address that
        derives to a boot file with a name of "92890905" produce boot
        file that includes:

        - an entry for every one of: ls /tftpboot/i386/*/kernel | perl
          -pi -e 's#/tftpboot/##' 

        - a reference to a messages file named
          "pxelinux.cfg/92890905.my-host" that contains a boot menu with
          menu items for each of the possible kernels from above.

        - Paul G.'s sample menu enabled pxe-boot file:

DISPLAY pxelinux.cfg/message.txt

your choices:

1.) local - This is the default action, it boots the local hard drive
	           it will happen in 5 seconds
	           or hit enter and it will happen now

- Talk to Admin before using any of the rest of these - 
2.) install - reinstall linux, resizes Hard drive
	             resize may break windows

3.) installwin - reinstalls the windows partition
	                will erase C: drive

4.) install-amd64 - reinstall linux on amd64 machines

        - generates a boot file for each client that looks like below,
          and includes a nice net-boot message for the client's console
          that explains their net-boot kernel choices:

14) Fix software raid
    # x1) get mdadm to store all necessary info in
    #    autoinstallscript.conf, if it is available on the client.
    # x2) put mdadm code in boel
    # x3) modify code to use that info to create proper commands in the
    #    auto-install script.
    # 4) include code to create new /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf to match the
    #    config, as user may have modified it in the
    #    autoinstallscript.conf
    #    file.
    # x5) modify code that uses "raidtools" to use mdadm instead.

16) BitTorrent:
#    - the following options should be user settable, parse them in the
#      kernel boot parameters (moreover tune the default values):
#        # Time to poll bittorrent events
#        bittorrent_polling_time=30
#        # Minimum upload rate threshold (in KB/s), if lesser stop seeding
#        bittorrent_upload_min=50

17) --autodetect-disks
        Option for si_getimage and si_mkautoinstallscript
        - if on, use David Lombard's disk independence code
        - if off, just use disk info from ai.conf file.

18) Move all LVM info into the <lvm> section of autoinstallscript.conf.

    - No longer store any lvm info in the <disk> and/or <raid> sections
    - Collect PV info and store it in the <lvm_group> section
        <lvm>
          <lvm_group>
            <pv device="/dev/sda1" />
            <pv device="/dev/md0"  />
            <pv device="/dev/md1"  />
            <lv name="swap" size="524288K" />
            <etc...>
          </lvm_group>
        </lvm>

    - Need to modify:
        - Server.pm
        - Common.pm
        - autoinstallscript.template

19) Test --dry-run option.  Email with details:

    Subject: [Sisuite-users] si_updateclient: differences b/w with and without --dry-run



20) Scott Jackson:  cciss disk names

    SI did not name the partitions on cciss disks
    correctly (I punted and avoided nodes with that disk type).

21) Scott Jackson:  ethernet re-ordering

    The most time consuming was not a SI problem per-se, but a problem
    in the recent Ubuntu packages where the system reorders the ethernet
    adapter names upon reboot. For instance on a node that has two
    ethernet adapters, on the install the ethernet adapters show up as
    eth0 and eth1, but after the reboot they are eth2 and eth3 with it
    being more or less random which one is the one attached to the
    network (the one with the lowest mac address). I tried several
    things but eventually had to copy in a modified
    /etc/network/interfaces in the post-install script which used an
    "external mapping function" to map the lowest mac address to the
    primary alias.  The resulting interfaces file is demonstrated below.

        root@node17:~# cat /etc/network/interfaces
        # The loopback interface
        # Interfaces that comes with Debian Potato does not like to see
        # "auto" option before "iface" for the first device specified.
        iface lo inet loopback
        auto lo

        auto eth0 eth1 eth2 eth3
        mapping eth0 eth1 eth2 eth3
                script /etc/network/set-first-primary.pl

        iface primary inet dhcp


    The content of the "external mapping function" is as follows:

        root@node17:/etc/network# cat set-first-primary.pl
        #!/usr/bin/perl -w
        use strict;

        my @macs =3D ();
        my %mac =3D ();

        open IFCONFIG, "/sbin/ifconfig -a | grep '^eth' |" or die "Unable to run
        ifconfig -a: $!\n";
        foreach my $line (<IFCONFIG>)
        {
            my ($nic, $link, $desc, $hwaddr, $mac) =3D split /\s+/, $line;
            $mac =3D lc $mac;
            push @macs, $mac;
            $mac{$nic} =3D $mac;
        }

        @macs =3D sort @macs;

        if ($mac{$ARGV[0]} eq $macs[0]) { print "primary\n"; exit 0; }
        else { exit 1; }


    Craziness!

    So, now we will begin writing support scripts around the systemimager
    framework to dynamically provision nodes.

    When I get really bold, I may try to create an image based on centos or
    some such OS so we can actually switch OSes:)

    Please let me know when there are deb packages for 3.7.3.

    THANK YOU VERY MUCH for all of your knowledgeable and willing help!

22) Bernard Li: smart kernel append for ramdisk_size

    ramdisk_size=80000

23) systemimager-imagemanip as a seperate rpm with appropriate
    dependencies


24) date > /tmp/start-time at start of install
    date > /tmp/end-time at end of install

    Then:
    echo Your install took started at `cat /tmp/start-time` 
    echo and completed at `cat /tmp/end-time`

25) test fat fs creation

26) retest successful autoinstall

27) Enable sshd in ramdisk such that you can ssh into the nodes from the image
    server in the event of imaging failure

28) si_monitortk improvements (thanks Bernard for the good suggestions):
    - display the full stdout and stderr of the client into the virtual
      console
    - add a cmdline option to choose the starting clients order
    - support multiple virtual console instances at the same time
    - allow to export the content of the virtual console in an txt file
    - add a popup menu on the client entries to display detailed info
      and perform special actions (like open virtual console, check
      availability of the node, delete entry, etc)
    - left click on the header to sort clients
    - tabbed view for virtual console
