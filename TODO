In Progress
-----------
Version 1.4.0 specific:

<brian@thefinleys.com>
----------------------
- getimage -ip virgin
- add an -autoconfig DEVICE option to updateclient that figures
  out the current values and writes them to /local.cfg
- series of slides as a HOW-TO
- series of slides for marketing
  - competitive analysis
    - kickstart
    - nothing at all
  - time saved
  - customer list
- systemimager-v1.4.x label in lilo instead of vanilla
- find out which GigE driver to include for VA
- Deal with tftp support (for network booting) on xinetd systems.
- Wes Smith's distribution specific patches
- have deb package created
- modify RPM spec file to deal with:
  - configuration files
  - additional files
  - changed files
  - use install to install files in install scripts
- put exclude/include stuff on imageserver by image
  /tftpboot/systemimager/$image.updateclient.include
  /tftpboot/systemimager/$image.updateclient.exclude
- deal with ext3 journal files differently according to Ted Ts'o
- label autoinstallcd.iso with v1.4.x (x is literal)
- start using bzip2
- Talk to Ian McLeod and Roland Drier about state of multicast


Possibilities for future versions
---------------------------------

<brian@thefinleys.com>
----------------------
- next minor release (1.5.x), make the -imageserver option go away
  in getimage.
- getimage -- exclude option
- if local.cfg and dhcp fails, have client ask for manual input
- redirect to serial port:
  - manual change to syslinux.cfg
  - maybe an append parameter if necessary
  - detect if serial is wanted by having rcS look for variable in
    - $image.master
    - local.cfg
- add a -quick-boot option to makeautoinstallfloppy
  - disclaimer -- may not work on all systems
- contemplate using MAKEDEV instead of having pre-existing device files
- fix network booting
- add -exclude option to getimage
- incorporate ssh
- incorporate casper (multicast by Aaron Hillegass <aaron@bignerdranch.com>)
- put autoinstallmedia source into cvs
- Record imagename to /etc/systemimager/current_image on client
  after an autoinstall (*.master) or an updateclient (if syncing from the root "/"). 
- consider inodes/block in getimage
- getimage -- blink option
- getimage -- eject option
- makeautoinstalldiskette -- consider adding config 
  file options?
- contemplate using wget to pull stuff?
- contemplate using khttpd to show autoinstall client status
- command to put mac addresses/host names into 
  /etc/dhcpd.conf by using broadcast pings, the arp 
  table, and /etc/hosts or dns.
- identify mke2fs parameters -b, -i, and -m on the master client and replicate this on autoinstall clients
- use something other than mtab for getting active ext2 filesystems?
- offer user the ability to change this, and store the changes in 
  /etc/systemimager.conf as IMAGESDIRECTORY="/var/spool/systemimager/images"
- add an --exclude option
- pass variables, such as $imagename to "addclients"
- (part of the making of the tftp-hpa RPM) need to add proper tftp entry in /etc/inetd.conf 
   for tftp-hpa rpm.  If systemimager is installed with tftp-hpa, then systemimager's 
   afterburner will make the proper changes to /etc/inetd.conf.
- make the <Backspace> key work ;)
- create man pages
- support for Caldera Open Linux
  - IF_LIST in /etc/sysconfig/network
- support for SuSE
- support for Slackware
- section of howto that helps Kickstart users transition to SystemImager.
- redirect syslog messages from autoinstall clients to $imagserver
- addclients -- accept command line input such as --image $imagename
- addclients -- re-cycle through each question if answer is ""
- have getimage question what should be excluded in future when updateimage 
  is run.  /tmp/* and /home/* should be recommended as a starting place.
- have client pull systemimager.exclude and systemimager.include from
  imageserver before pulling image


Greg Pratt <gpratt@valinux.com>
-------------------------------
- Docbookization of the FAQ-HOWTO


Cameron Meadors <cmeadors@valinux.com>
and Roland Dreier <roland@valinux.com>
--------------------------------------
- write a new tftp daemon to do that special PXE thang, so that we no longer 
  have to use the buggy tftp-hpa daemon.


Miscellaneous and Possibilities
-------------------------------
- commandline-ize the rest of the commands
- support for imageserver specification in DHCP client (hack dhcpcd)
- modify systemimager.exclude to deal with debian network info
- /etc/systemimager.conf file to hold things like domain name, nis domain, etc.
- support for dual boot systems (Linux/Windows with FAT/HPFS/NTFS)
- makedhcpserver -- autodiscover and calculate more information 
  (including if system has more than one network interface).
- makedhcpserver -- automatically change line in /etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcpd for you
- add more error checking (always) :)
- curses wrapper around the whole thing?
- updateclient - log what was updated and or deleted?
- makedhcpstatic -- allow for -f "filename" option to specify dhcpd.leases file.
