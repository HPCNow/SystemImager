Short list (in progress)
------------------------
- test makedhcpstatic and addclients for bugs
- create man pages
- update FAQ-HOWTO

Other stuff
-----------
- (part of the making of the tftp-hpa RPM) need to add proper tftp entry in /etc/inetd.conf 
   for tftp-hpa rpm.  If systemimager is installed with tftp-hpa, then systemimager's 
   afterburner will make the proper changes to /etc/inetd.conf.
- make bootable CD-ROM *.iso image available
- message during network booting (if possible)
- make the <Backspace> key work ;)
- multicast install -- Ian McLeod <ian@valinux.com> will have mftp (multicast ftp) 
  working as a drop in replacement for rsync by 5/15/2000 and we will begin testing
  in the lab.

getimage
--------
- $image.exclude on imageserver
- identify mke2fs parameters -b, -i, and -m on the master client and replicate this on autoinstall clients
- use something other than mtab for getting active ext2 filesystems?
- offer user the ability to change this, and store the changes in 
  /etc/systemimager.conf as IMAGESDIRECTORY="/var/spool/systemimager/images"
- add an --exclude option
- add "Do you want me open up the imageserver as a syslogd server?"
- pass variables, such as $imagename to "addclients"
- create disk partition sections of $image.master using MB instead of cylinders
  in order to support disks of different sizes. (not feasable at this point.)
  (there may be additional things to do on the prepareclient side as well)
  (perhaps use a virtual disk presented to a "real" fdisk to allow user partitioning? --
   or maybe just calculate partition information with the script and ask the user to specify sizes)

addclients
----------
- test for valid numbers and IP addresses
- test for both IP addresses and hostnames in /etc/hosts
- accept command line input such as --image $imagename
- re-cycle through each question if answer is ""
- use FQHN in soft links?

systemimager.exclude
--------------------
- Have getimage question what should be excluded in future when updateimage 
  is run.  /tmp/* and /home/* should be recommended as a starting place.
- Add support for a systemimager.include file
- make systemimager.exclude and systemimager.include image specific.
  (systemimager.exclude.$image)

updateclient
-----------
- have client pull systemimager.exclude and systemimager.include from
  imageserver before pulling image

Miscellaneous and Possibilities
-------------------------------
- add more error checking (always) :)
- Dan of Argonne says there may be a better way of identifying the
  imageserver via DHCP.  This has been verified -- you can make a
  statement such as:
   option option-100 "10.0.0.8";
  in the /etc/dhcpd.conf file to make up your own option that specifies
  the address of the imageserver.  However, only the ISC's own dhclient
  seems to be able to take made up options, and it is not the dhcp client
  of choice (for several reasons).  Maybe the other clients, dhcpcd and
  pump, will find their way along soon...
- Use statically compiled rsyncd.systemimager & funky port number?
- Track state of nodes?
- Script to do software inventory of nodes via RPM database? or deb database? 
  or track all files?
- curses and/or gui wrapper around the whole thing -- Wesley Smith 
  <wessmith@engr.sgi.com> is working on this.  Rhino, I think they're calling it.
- updateclient - log what was updated and or deleted?

makedhcpserver 
--------------
- autodiscover and calculate more information 
  (including if system has more than one network interface).

makedhcpstatic
--------------
- allow for -f "filename" option to specify dhcpd.leases file.

systemimager.conf
-----------------
- SYSTEMIMAGER_ROOT=$path
- SYSTEMIMAGER_FQHN=$boolean
- EXCLUDE=$path $path $path

autoinstalldiskette 
-------------------
- no screen-blanking
- redirect syslog messages to $imagserver
- more diags on autoinstall client
