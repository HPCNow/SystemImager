makedhcpserver

Top priorities 
(generally speaking, broken stuff will be fixed before new features are added)
--------------
autoinstalldiskette 
- no screen-blanking
- use bootp enabled kernel and do an append="no-bootp" or whatever
- incorporate the ability to do network booting for installs
  (also using syslinux)
- redirect syslog messages to $imagserver

Other stuff
-----------
- multicast install
- offer user the ability to change this, and store the changes in 
  /etc/systemimager.conf as IMAGESDIRECTORY="/var/spool/systemimager/images"

makedhcpstatic
- default in RH 6.1 is to not put DHCP info in /var/log/messages?
  RH 6.1 uses /var/state/dhcp/dhcpd.leases.  change program to check for
  this file or /etc/dhcpd.leases and use the newer file (if there are two).
  Also allow for -f "filename" option.

autoinstalldiskette 
- SystemImager vs. autoinstalldiskette version checking against server?

getimage
- add an --exclude option
- add "Do you want me open up the imageserver as a syslogd server?"
- ask if hosts autoinstalled from this image will use static IP or 
  dhcp _after_ install
- pass variables, such as $imagename to "addclients"

addclients
- test for both IP addresses and hostnames in /etc/hosts
- accept command line input such as --image $imagename
- re-cycle through each question if answer is ""
- provide list of images from which to choose 
- use FQHN in soft links?

systemimager.exclude
- Have getimage question what should be excluded in future when updateimage 
  is run.  /tmp/* and /home/* should be recommended as a starting place.
- Add support for a systemimager.include file

updateimage
- have client pull systemimager.exclude and systemimager.include from
  imageserver before pulling image

Miscellaneous and Possibilities
- "perlify" the rest of the server side scripts
- add more error checking
- Complete HOW-TO/FAQ
- Dan of Argonne says there may be a better way of identifying the
  imageserver via DHCP.  This has been verified -- you can make a
  statement such as:
   option option-100 "10.0.0.8";
  in the /etc/dhcpd.conf file to make up your own option that specifies
  the address of the imageserver.  However, only the ISC's own dhclient
  seems to be able to take made up options, and it is not the dhcp client
  of choice (for several reasons).  Maybe the other clients, dhcpcd and
  pump, will find their way along soon...
- Use statically compiled rsyncd.systemimager & funky port number?
- Track state of nodes?
- Script to do software inventory of nodes via RPM database? or deb database? 
  or track all files?
- nis friendly
- curses style wrapper around the whole thing
- updateimage - log what was updated and or deleted?
- updateimage - check whether files will be destroyed and throw an interactive 
  check to the user? -- probably not.
- modify defaults
- make everything work with either DNS or hosts
- spellcheck everything

makedhcpserver 
- autodiscover and calculate more information 
  (including if system has more than one network interface).

systemimager.conf
- SYSTEMIMAGER_ROOT=$path
- SYSTEMIMAGER_FQHN=$boolean
- EXCLUDE=$path $path $path
