2) need to identify more modules that are not necessary for a typical
   install, and add those to the etc/UYOK.modules_to_exclude file.

4) need to remove discover and discover-data bits, and all references to
   them.  this functionality now provided by udev + hotplug

   (postponed -- don't think having discover there hurts anything, and
    it may help -BEF-)

5) consider using modprobe instead of insmod for re-loading modules

    (non-critical, just something to contemplate -BEF-)

6) Add a kernel-devel tree package, like those that ship with RedHat, 
   Ubuntu, etc. There's just enough data to build boot-kernel modules 
   against, but nothing else. 
   
   Ie: kernel-headers. (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

7) A boel_binaries_template, just like the initrd, so additional
   drivers can be dropped into /lib/modules/<kernel_ver>/. 
   (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

8) Standard kernel to have only modular drivers for:
   - all network devices
   - all storage devices
   (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

9) Include mkrecoveryISO in the standard release.

10) si_mkbootmedia.  Status?

11) si_mkautoinstallcd -- deal with fs sizing more gracefully
