1) hotplug startup is slow.  need to figure out why and speed it up.

2) need to identify more modules that are not necessary for a typical
   install, and add those to the etc/UYOK.modules_to_exclude file.

3) there is most definitely a grub problem.  dannf, any chance you can
   take a peek at that?  I see it when doing an auto-install of an ubuntu
   client using grub to boot.  I expect it happens in other cases too,
   but that should be an easily re-creatable one.  Oh yeah, this is using
   the UYOK boot package from that client too (don't know if that
   matters.)

4) need to remove discover and discover-data bits, and all references to
   them.  this functionality now provided by udev + hotplug

5) consider using modprobe instead of insmod for re-loading modules

   I'd be particularly interested in help with bits 1, 2, and 3. (BEF)

   Also, it looks like David Lombard's disk independence patches are already
   in the code.  Wahoo!  I need to take a closer look and see if any
   further integration needs to be done.

   Notice that when you do an "si_mkautoinstallcd" that it now allows you
   to choose a UYOK boot package based on the kernel/initrd.img from the
   image you just pulled. ;-)

6) Add a kernel-devel tree package, like those that ship with RedHat, 
   Ubuntu, etc. There's just enough data to build boot-kernel modules 
   against, but nothing else. Ie: kernel-headers. (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

7) A boel_binaries_template, just like the initrd, so additional
   drivers can be dropped into /lib/modules/<kernel_ver>/. 
   (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

8) Standard kernel to have only modular drivers for:
   - all network devices
   - all storage devices
   (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

Misc.
--------------------------------------
- remove discover and discover-data
    - and deal appropriately with all functions that use discover
