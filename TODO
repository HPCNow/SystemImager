2) need to identify more modules that are not necessary for a typical
   install, and add those to the etc/UYOK.modules_to_exclude file.

4) need to remove discover and discover-data bits, and all references to
   them.  this functionality now provided by udev + hotplug

   (postponed -- don't think having discover there hurts anything, and
    it may help -BEF-)

5) consider using modprobe instead of insmod for re-loading modules

    (non-critical, just something to contemplate -BEF-)

6) Add a kernel-devel tree package, like those that ship with RedHat, 
   Ubuntu, etc. There's just enough data to build boot-kernel modules 
   against, but nothing else. 
   
   Ie: kernel-headers. (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

7) A boel_binaries_template, just like the initrd, so additional
   drivers can be dropped into /lib/modules/<kernel_ver>/. 
   (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

8) Standard kernel to have only modular drivers for:
   - all network devices
   - all storage devices
   (Jeremy Siadal suggestion)

9) Include mkrecoveryISO in the standard release.

10) si_mkbootmedia.  Status?

11) si_mkautoinstallcd -- deal with fs sizing more gracefully

12) si_mvimage bug ($file)

13) improved tftpbooting architecture

    Location:
        ln -s /usr/share/systemimager/boot /tftpboot

    In that location:
        ia64/standard
            /elilo.efi (provided as part of ia64 standard boot package)
        i386/standard
            /pxelinux.bin (provided as part of i386 standard boot package)
            /pxelinux.cfg (provided as part of i386 standard boot package)
        x86_64/standard
              /pxelinux.bin (provided as part of x86_64 standard boot package)
              /pxelinux.cfg (provided as part of x86_64 standard boot package)
        etc...

    si_mkbootserver
        - for now, just hardcode a softlink from /tftpboot ->
          /usr/share/systemimager/boot
        - later, re-write in perl and try to improve interaction

    si_mkclientnetboot
        - Paul G. will send a sample menu enabled pxe-boot file.
        - generates a boot file for each client that looks like below,
          and includes a nice net-boot message for the client's console
          that explains their net-boot kernel choices:

            DEFAULT standard

            #
            # Uncomment next line to send pxelinux boot prompt over
            # serial port 0.
            # NOTE: Be sure your serial port speed is appropriate
            # (57600, 9600, etc.)
            #
            #SERIAL 0 57600
            DISPLAY message.txt
            PROMPT 1
            TIMEOUT 50

            # Add the following to the append line above to use your
            # first serial port
            # (ttyS0) as a console in addition to your monitor (tty0).
            # NOTE: Be sure
            # your serial port speed is appropriate (57600, 9600, etc.)
            #
            #console=ttyS0,57600

            # Add the following to the append line above to increase the
            # size of your tmpfs
            # filesystem.  About 100MB larger than your image size
            # should suffice.
            #
            # Other tmpfs mount options are also supported.  See the FAQ
            # for details.
            #tmpfs_size=800M

            LABEL standard
            KERNEL i386/i386-dapper-server/kernel
            APPEND vga=extended
            initrd=i386/i386-dapper-server/initrd.img root=/dev/ram

            LABEL i386-dapper-server
            KERNEL i386/i386-dapper-server/kernel
            APPEND vga=extended
            initrd=i386/i386-dapper-server/initrd.img root=/dev/ram

14) Fix software raid
    # 1) get mdadm to store all necessary info in
    #    autoinstallscript.conf, if it is available on the client.
    # 2) put mdadm code in boel
    # 3) modify code to use that info to create proper commands in the
    #    auto-install script.
    # 4) include code to create new /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf to match the
    #    config, as user may have modified it in the
    #    autoinstallscript.conf
    #    file.
    # 5) modify code that uses "raidtools" to use mdadm instead.
    # 6) if system had /etc/raidtab, then re-create /etc/raidtab _and_
    #    /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf to match current config.

15) Minor:
    - parted no longer requires fstype with mkpart.  as in, we can now
      do:

        mkpart primary 0 -0
        mkpart primary 100 160000
        etc.
