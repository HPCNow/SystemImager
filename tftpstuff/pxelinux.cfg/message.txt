0e
0e  This is the SystemImager autoinstall system.  If you do not want your 
0e  system to be autoinstalled, poweroff now!
0e
0e  The autoinstall system will partition your hard drives, create
0e  filesystems on your partitions, and create your swap space.  It will 
0e  then contact your imageserver and install the designated image on this
0e  machine.
0e
0e  It will then shutdown the OS and it will no longer respond to pings.  
0e  At that point, it is safe to reboot and use your autoinstalled system.
0e
0e  Have fun!  -Brian Finley <brian@thefinleys.com>
