0c                         Welcome to VA SystemImager
0e
0e  This is the VA SystemImager autoinstall system.  If you do not want 
0e  your system to be autoinstalled, power off now!
0e
0e  The autoinstall system will partition your hard drives, create
0e  filesystems on your partitions, and create your swap space.  It will 
0e  then contact your imageserver and install the designated image on this
0e  machine.
0e
0e  It will then shutdown the OS and it will no longer respond to pings.  
0e  At that point, it is safe to reboot and use your autoinstalled system.
0e
0e  Have fun!  -Brian Finley <brian@valinux.com>
