Developer Guidelines
--------------------
o Current development branch is tagged "HEAD".  This is the default.  
  Most developers will use this.  To check out the development branch,
  see "CVS Checkout Steps for Developers for the Development Branch"
  below.
o The stable branch is only to be used for fixing bugs.  To check out
  the stable branch see "CVS Checkout Steps for Developers for the 
  Stable Branch (bug fixes only)" below.
o Only Brian Finley will modify CVS tags of any kind, such as for versioning 
  releases or creating development branches.
o Always get approval from Brian Finley prior to adding any new files or 
  directories to CVS.
o You may modify sections in the TODO file bearing your name.
o When you finish an item in your section of the TODO file:
  o Add an appropriate line to the CHANGE.LOG file before removing the 
    item from the TODO file (so we don't forget about keen changes 
    we've made).
  o Send an email to the <systemimager-devel> list announcing completion.
o Always give people credit in the CREDITS file.
o Do not modify anyone elses section.
o Have fun!

CVS Checkout Steps for Developers for the Development Branch
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Checkout the code:
   "cvs -z3 -d:ext:developer_name@cvs.systemimager.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/systemimager co systemimager"
2) Rename the checked out source tree (suggested):
   "mv systemimager systemimager.HEAD"


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
CVS Checkout Steps for Developers for the ia64 specific Unstable Branch
(This branch is a special case.  Normally, there will only be HEAD for 
 development)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose your branch:
   "BRANCH=unstable-2_1_x"
2) Checkout the code:
   "cvs -z3 -d:ext:developer_name@cvs.systemimager.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/systemimager co -r $BRANCH systemimager"
3) Rename the checked out source tree (suggested):
   "mv systemimager systemimager.$BRANCH"


------------------------------------------------------------------------
CVS Checkout Steps for Developers for the Stable Branch (bug fixes only)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Choose your branch:
   "BRANCH=stable-2_0_x"
2) Checkout the code:
   "cvs -z3 -d:ext:developer_name@cvs.systemimager.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/systemimager co -r $BRANCH systemimager"
3) Rename the checked out source tree (suggested):
   "mv systemimager systemimager.$BRANCH"


----------
Versioning
----------
o SystemImager uses kernel style versioning (X.Y.Z):
  o X = major architectural change
  o Y = feature release
    o an odd number indicates a development release (leading up to an even numbered stable release)
    o an even number indicates a stable release
  o Z = bug fix release (no new features)

o We make the unstable packages available as downloads, but with warnings, etc.

o We don't put the unstable systemimager packages into Debian unstable, at least not until
  the systemimager stable packages make it into Debian stable, but maybe not even then.

o Outside of the Debian contemplation above, if someone wants access to the development
  code, it must be downloaded via systemimager.org, and we do our best to resist having it 
  packaged in any kind of release (I know we can't really control this, but we often have influence)

o Announcements on the website are only updated for stable package releases, but
  We have an ongoing general statement about development releases available here: (pointer to sf download page)

o Examples from the current tree (as of 2001.12.14):
  o stable-2_0_x, getting bug fixes only
  o unstable-2_1_x, ia64 feature branch
    o soon to be stable and we can release it as 2.2.0 and leave stable-2_0_x behind
  o HEAD, will continue on as HEAD, releases will be called 2.3.0, 2.3.1, etc.
    o when it's ready, it will hatch into 2.4.0 and be branched as stable-2_4_x

  o So for now, we'll have three active branches, stable-2_0_x, unstable-2_1_x, and 
    HEAD, but in the future, we will only have a single active stable-?_?_x branch 
    and HEAD (no unstable-?_?_x branch will be necessary).


It is now law.
