SUBJECT:
SystemImager 2.9.2 is Released, and 3.0.0 is Mostly Frozen


BODY:
Greetings and salutations,

SystemImager(R) unstable 2.9.2 is released.  This is a development 
release leading up to the 3.0 release. 

Official "testers" should test this release and send feedback to
<sisuite-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>.  For others who test this 
release, please send a quick "it worked on my box" message to 
the same list.

To install, cut and paste the following commands:

    wget URL...
    sh scriptname



What to expect from this development release, and from SystemImager 3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following are some of the key features or modifications that will be
included in the next stable release, SystemImager v3.0.

    * SIS (System Installation Suite) script for easy installation
      on RPM based distributions.  Debian installation is still as 
      easy as lickety-split!  

      SystemImager is a component of System Installation Suite, and
      it is recommended that you install the entire suite.  The 
      entire suite includes SystemInstaller, SystemImager, and 
      System Configurator.

    * Modular kernel
        * SCSI, file system, other drivers compiled as modules.
        * Network drivers compiled in statically.
        * Many more network drivers compiled in.
        * Gigabit Ethernet support on autoinstall clients.
        * "Module only" drivers can be used, including network
          drivers.
        * Allows a "complete" kernel to be provided with
          SystemImager
        * Makes it possible to add support for additional file
          systems much more easily.

    * USB keyboard support on autoinstall client machines.

    * addclients
        * now allows leading zeros for client host names
        * recommends the use of DNS instead of /etc/hosts

    * Hardware auto-detection
        * Necessary modules are automatically loaded.

    * devfs is used
        * Eliminates the need to keep up with device files for new
          block devices as they get added (Hardware RAID controllers
          for example).
        * Building of initrd.gz from source code happens faster.

    * tmpfs
        * BOEL(2) now uses tmpfs as its root file system.
        * Size constraint of files that can be copied to the in
          memory file system on autoinstall clients is effectively
          eliminated.  See
          /usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt for
          details.

    * Additional filesystems now supported.  The complete list now
      includes:
        * ext2
        * ext3
        * FAT (12, 16, and 32 bit)
        * JFS
        * reiserfs
        * XFS
    * boel_binaries tarball
        * A single tarball of additional binaries (that don't fit on
          the autoinstall media) is now pulled over to autoinstall
          clients once network connectivity is achieved.
        * This tarball contains additional kernel modules and other
          binaries, such as mke2fs, mkraid, mkreiserfs, and their
          shared libraries.

    * Many additional features in BOEL including:
        * a "vi" editor
        * filename completion in the shell
        * syslogd
          * Auto-install clients can send their syslog messages to 
            the image server, or to a separate logging server.

    * HP Smart Array 5xxx series
        * Support for the HP Smart Array 5xxx series of hardware
          RAID controllers has been added.  These devices use
          /dev/cciss/* device files.

    * Other HP Smart Array controllers
        * Support for HP Smart Array controllers that use /dev/ida/*
          device files has been added.

    * IA64
        * IA64 support has been added.
        * GPT (GUID Partition Table) support has been added.

    * Build environment
        * The entire SystemImager package can be built on any
          distribution.  It is no longer limited to a hand modified
          version of a specific Debian release.  
        * Debian rocks, and I will continue to use it as *my*
          development environment, but this will make it much easier
          for packaging into other distributions, and for
          maintaining past releases.

    * Dynamic Partitioning support
        * Giving users the ability to specify percentages or
          megabytes for partition schemes.
        * Easily change file system types used by an image.  This
          will an image pulled from a golden client using ext2 to be
          deployed on a machine as XFS, for example.
        * Easily change destination disks.  This will allow an image
          pulled from a machine with IDE disks to be installed on a
          machine with SCSI disks.
        * A single image can be used across machines using different
          drive types and different file system types.

    * netbootmond and mkclientnetboot
        * The ability to control which PXE enabled machines boot
          from the network, and when they boot.  This will give the
          system administrator control over network booting so that
          a machine can be made to boot from the network for an
          autoinstall, but not boot from the network after
          completing the install.
        * The imageserver can be configured to make PXE enabled
          machines automatically boot off their own hard drives 
          after successful completion of a PXE based SystemImager 
          install.  
        * This allows you to plug in your brand new machines
          (configured to use PXE at the factory) and simply turn 
          them on.  On the first boot, the SystemImager imageserver
          will install them, and on subsequent boots, it will tell 
          them to boot off their own hard drives!
        
Certainly it's not possible to include all improvements here, but as you
can see, there have been quite a few.  Many of them are structural
changes that will significantly improve our ability to add support to
SystemImager for new file systems, hardware, and architectures.  

And of course you will see a number of bug fixes.  The 2.0.x series 
happened to be a particularly buggy series.  Funding levels have 
increased, allowing me to concentrate more time and effort on 
SystemImager and I'm anticipating that v3.0 will be a very 
stable release.

If you have other features or modifications that you would like to see,
please submit a feature request (http://systemimager.org/support/) or
contact <sales@baldguysoftware.com> to commission development.  If a
feature you are interested in is already listed, please add a "ME TOO!"
comment as a logged in SourceForge user.  This will help us determine
demand for certain features.

Notes:  

        1. All of this is subject to change prior to release.
        2. BOEL is Brian's Own Embedded Linux.  It is the embedded Linux
           used to autoinstall clients.

Please feel free to forward this message on to other lists, or groups
that use SystemImager and System Installation Suite (SIS).

Cheers, -Brian
