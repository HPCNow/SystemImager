Building SystemImager
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SystemImager should now build on most any distribution, as well as work on any
distribution.  The SystemImager team is no longer supporting "installable 
tarballs", but instead provide packages for RPM and Debian based distributions.

If you must build SystemImager yourself, it should now be possible on any
distribution.  Please refer to the Makefile for details.
