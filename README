First things first
------------------
o All documentation is in the /usr/share/doc/systemimager-* directory

o Read at *least* the HOWTO section of the manual:
  1)  "cd /usr/share/doc/systemimager-*/manual/"
  2)  "lynx html/index.html"
    or
      "netscape html/index.html &"
    or
      "acroread pdf/systemimager-manual.pdf"

o See the FAQ section of the manual if you still have questions

o If you *still* have questions, send them to the systemimager-discuss 
  email list.  You can sign up for this list at http://systemimager.org/.

o Now that you've read the documentation, you don't need me to tell you
  how to install it :)
