0c                         Welcome to SystemImager


0e  This is the SystemImager autoinstall system vSYSTEMIMAGER_VERSION_STRING.  If you do not want 
0e  this system to be autoinstalled, power off now!

0e  The autoinstall system will partition your hard drives, create filesystems
0e  on your partitions, and create your swap space.  It will then contact your
0e  imageserver and install the designated image on this machine.

0e  If you find this software useful, please consider making contributing code
0e  or documentation to the project.  Thanks!

0e  You can find documentation and support at 0bhttp://systemimager.org

0e  Have fun!
