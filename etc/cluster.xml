		This is the global override: all the files stored into this
		override will be pushed to all the clients.
	-->
        <override>all</override>
	<!--
		Following there is an example of a "fake" group. The group
		name is "Local", it uses the override in
		/var/lib/systemimager/overrides/Local and it contains only
		the localhost server.

        </group>
	<!--
		This is a group that contains two nodes: node001 and
		node002. The group is called "Login" and it uses the
		override:
		/var/lib/systemimager/overrides/RHEL4_frontend

		All the files present in this overrides will be
		distributed to node001 and node002 only using
		si_pushoverrides.

                <node>node001,node002</node>

	<!--
		Another example. The group Storage contains 16 nodes and
		use the override:
		/var/lib/systemimager/overrides/RHEL4_Storage
	-->
	<group>
                <name>Storage</name>
                <override>RHEL4_Storage</override>
