	Every once in a while, someone reports some mysterious hanging, or
	transfer interruption issue related to rsync.  I had a chance to
	speak with Andrew Tridgell in person today to discuss these issues.
      </Para>
      <Para>
	There are two know issues that could be the source of these symptoms.
	One is a known kernel issue, and one is an rsync issue.  The kernel
	issue is supposedly resolved in 2.4.x series kernels, (SystemImager
	has not yet been "officially" tested with 2.4.x kernels) and may not
	be present in all 2.2.x series kernels (I believe).
      </Para>
      <Para>
	The rsync bug will be fixed in the rsync 2.4.7 release (to happen 
	"Real Soon Now (TM)" ).  The rsync bug is caused by excessive numbers
	of errors filling the error queue which causes a race condition.
	However, until rsync 2.4.7 has been out for some time, I will still
	recommend using v2.4.6 unless you specifically experience one of
	these issues.
      </Para>
      <Para>
	Here's a hack that seems to work for Chris Black.  Add "--bwlimit=10000" 
	right after "rsync" in each rsync command in the &lt;image&gt;.master script.

      If you must use a pre v0.19 version for some reason, be sure that your 
      kernel has "ramdisk" support or that you have ramdisk support with a 
      module.  If you are using a module, be sure that it is loaded with the 
      <command>modprobe</command> command; however it's probably easier to get the latest version.

      Be sure that the image server can look up the client's hostname based

        autoinstalldiskette bring the ethernet interface up and wait 45 seconds
        or so before making a DHCP request.  It will then wait 35 seconds or
        so to give the system time to receive an address.  You could be using
        an autoinstalldiskette that does not wait the proper time for your
        switch and is giving up before it should.

      This failure is most commonly associated with a mismatch between the

      of SystemImager you used to create the corresponding .master script.
    </para>
    <para>
      As of SystemImager 2.0, SystemConfigurator is used to make final
      configuration changes to an image.  SystemConfigurator is executed from
      within the image, so it must be installed within the image on the image
      server.  To insure this, SystemConfigurator must be installed on any 
      golden client before an image is pulled from it.  If you have images 
      that were pulled from golden clients that did not have 
      SystemConfigurator installed, you can install SystemConfigurator 
      directly into the image on the imagserver.
      Are you using a pre 1.0 version of SystemImager?  If so, please
      upgrade.

      My client completes the autoinstall process successfully, but I get an
      "Invalid Partition Table" error upon reboot, and Linux never boots.
    </title>
    <para>
      SystemImager 2.0.x and earlier didn't maintain the bootable flag in
      the partition table.  This worked fine in most cases, but in some cases
      this leads to an unbootable system.  To confirm that this is the problem,
      boot your system from rescue media, and set the bootable flag on your
      boot partition using cfdisk or another partitioning tool.  If this
      allows your system to boot, then you must upgrade SystemImager and
      regenerate your autoinstallscript(s).
