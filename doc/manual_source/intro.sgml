    <title>SystemImager Overview</title>
    <para>
      <application>SystemImager</application>, a component of the
      <application>System Installation Suite</application>, is software that allows you to
      install Linux to large numbers of similar machines relatively easily.
      You can also use it for software distribution, configuration, and
      operating system updates, in addition to using it to update from one
      Linux release or version to another.
      <application>SystemImager</application> can also be used for content
      management on web servers.  
    </para>
    
    <para>
      You will find SystemImager most useful in environments where you have
      large numbers of identical machines, including Internet server farms,
      high performance clusters, computer labs, or corporate desktop
      environments where all workstations have the same basic hardware
      configuration.  For more background information on design goals and
      product development, see "SystemImager Background."

    <title>How SystemImager Works</title>
    <para>
      SystemImager allows you to retrieve an entire system image from a
      golden client, which is a manually installed, customized machine, to
      an image server, which is the machine that will hold and distribute
      system images.  You can deploy the images to any number of client
      systems from the image server.
    </para>
    <para>
      After initial image deployment, you can update the client systems by
      syncing them to an updated image on the image server.  Updates are fast
      and efficient because only the modified parts of files are pulled to
      the client.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>Supported Distributions</title>
      <para>
	<application>SystemImager</application> uses 
	<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/systemconfig">
	  <application>System Configurator</application> 
	</ulink> to custom configure autoinstall clients for specific distributions.  
	Through System Configurator, SystemImager supports all major Linux distributions 
	and most others, including custom or in-house distributions.
	Using "footprints," System Configurator works
	with distributions based on their system configuration style rather than
	needing to know the name of the distribution. To determine a system's footprint, System Configurator 
	identifies the configuration files in use and associates that footprint with a configuration style.
	It then correctly makes settings, such as hostname or IP address, without needing to know the 
	name of the distribution.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	Following is an incomplete list of distributions known to work with 
	<application>SystemImager</application>.  If you are successfully 
	using <application>SystemImager</application> with a distribution or 
	version not listed here, please submit a
	<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=259">
	  bug report
	</ulink>, 
	so the distribution can be added to the list.  Though not a bug,
	reporting the success here is the best way to communicate the
	information.

      <title>System Requirements</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Your image server must have enough disk space to hold the images
	    to be installed on your client systems.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    All clients that will use the same image should have hardware
	    that is as similar as possible.  Most importantly they should use
	    the same chipset on the network device(s) and the same number and
	    kind of hard drive(s) (e.g. IDE, SCSI, Mylex Hardware RAID, etc.)  The
	    hard drives may be of different capacities, and disks may be
	    larger with no problem and smaller within reason.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    For PXE installations, you need a compatible TFTP server
	    running on the boot server, which is usually the same machine as
	    the image/DHCP server. Debian provides this server in the
	    tftpd-hpa package, and Red Hat 7.0 and later include this server
	    in the tftp-server package.  H. Peter Anvin maintains the
	    <application>tftp-hpa</application> package that provides the
	    required functionality.  The atftpd server is also reported
	    to work.  
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    In addition to a compatible TFTP server, PXE network-based
	    installations may also require a PXE daemon to run on your
	    image server.  This requirement depends on the firmware used on
	    the client side and the capabilities of your DHCP server.
