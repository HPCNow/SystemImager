      <title>SystemImager Overview</title>
      <para>
	<application>SystemImager</application> is software that allows you to
	install Linux to large numbers of similar machines relatively easy.
	You can also use it for software distribution, configuration, and
	operating system updates, in addition to using it to update from one
	Linux release or version to another.
	<application>SystemImager</application> can also be used for content
	management on web servers.  
      </para>
      
      <para>
	You will find SystemImager most useful in environments where you have
	large numbers of identical machines, including Internet server farms,
	high performance clusters, computer labs, or corporate desktop
	environments where all workstations have the same basic hardware
	configuration.  For more background information on design goals and
	product development, see "History of SystemImager".

      <title>How SystemImager Works</title>
      <para>
	SystemImager allows you to retrieve an entire system image from a
	golden client, which is a manually installed, customized machine, to
	an image server, which is the machine that will hold and distribute
	the system image.  You can deploy the image to any number of client
	systems from the image server.
      </para>
      <para>
	After initial image deployment, you can update the client systems by
	syncing them to an updated image on the image server.  Updates are fast
	and efficient because only the modified parts of files are pulled to
	the client.
      </para>
      <section>
	<title>Supported Distributions</title>
	<para>
	  <application>SystemImager</application> uses the
	  <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/systemconfig">
	    <application>SystemConfigurator</application>
	  </ulink> utility, which provides all distribution and architecture
	  dependent functionality.  Therefore,
	  <application>SystemImager</application> should work with any
	  distribution that is supported by
	  <application>SystemConfigurator</application>.  If you are using an
	  untested distribution, you may find that the networking and hostname
	  information are not configured properly after doing an autoinstall.
	  If you try <application>SystemImager</application> with your favorite
	  distribution and it doesn't work properly, please submit a
	  <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=259">
	    bug report
	  </ulink>, preferably with patches you've created to fix the problem.
	  Appropriate credit is given to all who find and submit valid bugs or
	  contribute code or documentation that is used.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  Here is an incomplete list of distributions known to work with 
	  <application>SystemImager</application>.  If you are successfully 
	  using <application>SystemImager</application> with a distribution or 
	  version not listed here, please submit a
	  <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=259">
	    bug report
	  </ulink>, 
	  so we can add them to the list.  (Not a bug I know, but this is the
	  best way to report success!)

	      Your image server must have enough disk space to hold the images
	      to be installed on your client systems.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      All clients that will use the same image should have hardware
	      that is as similar as possible.  Most importantly they should use
	      the same chipset on the network device(s) and the same number and
	      kind of hard drive(s) (IDE, SCSI, Mylex Hardware RAID, etc.)  The
	      hard drives may be of different capacities.  Devices may be
	      larger with no problem and can be smaller within reason.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      For PXE installations, you will need a compatible TFTP server
	      running on the boot server, which is usually the same machine as
	      the image/DHCP server.  H. Peter Anvin maintains the
	      <application>tftp-hpa</application> package, which provides the
	      required functionality.  Debian provides this server in the
	      tftpd-hpa package, and RedHat 7.0 and later include this server
	      in the tftp-server package.  The atftpd server is also reported
	      to work.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      In addition to a compatible TFTP server, PXE network-based
	      installations may also require a PXE daemon to run on your
	      image server.  This requirement depends on the firmware used on
	      the client side and the capabilities of your DHCP server.

	  <para>
	    Tells your image server which image to install on your
	    autoinstall clients.  It does so by creating soft links to the 
	    master autoinstall script with the name of each host that will 
	    receive that image.  It also allows you to populate the /etc/hosts 
	    file with sequential host names and IP addresses.  This information
	    in <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> is necessary for certain
	    SystemImager operations.

	    CDROM, the network, or the local hard drive of the autoinstall
	    client.

	    A unique autoinstall script is created for each image and is used
	    by the autoinstall client as part of the autoinstall process.  The

	    and end in .master.  For example:
	    <filename>my_webserver_image_v1.master</filename>

	    This is not specifically a SystemImager term, but it really bugs me
	    when people pronounce this word as "daymen".  It is just another,
	    more interesting, less evil appearing way of spelling demon.  And
	    just to be clear, in computer terms, a daemon is a program that
	    lies in wait for something to trigger it into action.  An example
	    of this is a web server daemon waiting for someone to request a web
	    page.
