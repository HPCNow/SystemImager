# upgrade_config_files() compares already-installed configuration files with
#   the new, virgin config files that are a part of this release.  if there is
#   a preexisting config file, it is backed up.  if the preexisting version
#   differs from the virgin version, the user is warned.
#
# input:  $CONFIG_FILES
#         $CONFIG_FILES is a list of configuration filename pairs.  the first
#         filename in the pair is the full pathname of the config file on an
#         installed system.  the second filename in each pair is the path
#
#         separated from the next w/ whitespace.  the two files in each pair
#         are separated from each other with a ":".
#         Example:
#           CONFIG_FILES="/etc/systemimager/server.conf:`pwd`/etc/server.conf /etc/init.d/systemimager:`pwd`/debian/systemimager-server.init"

# remove_old_files() looks for files that are sitting around from old

#   non-user-configurable files, where overwriting the old version is
#   safe.

# input:  $OLD_FILES
