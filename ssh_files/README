#  The files in this directory are provided as part of SystemImager.
#  They are used by SystemImager autoinstall clients to do secure installs.
#  See http://systemimager.org/ for more information.
# 
#  In order to do a secure install without placing private keys on a floppy for
#  each machine beforehand, you must place an "authorized_keys" file in this 
#  directory that has the *public* key for each user that will need to access
#  the autoinstall client to continue the install.
