Quick Start
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A script named like this one (99all.harmless_example_script) -- that 
is, two digits followed by "all", then a period ".", then a 
description "harmless_example_script" -- will run for _all_ of your 
clients and images. 


How post-install scripts are processed
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- They are run from the auto-install script, after all post-imaging 
  configuration is performed, and right before the client's filesystems 
  are unmounted.

- The entire "post-install" directory is copied to /tmp/post-install/ on 
  the client's new filesystem.

- Each script is tested for non-zero exit status, and the install will
  "shellout" if any of the scripts exits with non-zero status.

- Each script is executed individually inside a chroot of the new root 
  filesystem on the client.  The newly installed client filesystem is 
  mounted on /a/, so the actual script execution looks something like:
  
      "chmod +x /a/tmp/post-install/$POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT"
      "chroot /a/ /tmp/post-install/$POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT"

  This means that you can write your scripts as if they were executing on a
  normally operating machine (with few exceptions).

- Scripts should be named in this way:
  
  Two digit number to indicate order within a class.
  | Class name.
  | |  Period, followed by your description of the script.
  | |  |
  | |  |
  v v  v
  99all.harmless_example_script

  Classes include: 
  - $IMAGENAME      (Ie: my_compute_image)
  - $BASE_HOSTNAME  (Ie: compute)
  - $HOSTNAME       (Ie: compute07)
  - all
  - $OVERRIDE
  
  Scripts are ordered and executed first by class, then by number within 
  a class.  If you have multiple $OVERRIDE directories, they will be 
  executed in the order specified in your auto-install script.
