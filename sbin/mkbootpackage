Usage: mkbootpackage --kernel FILE --modules DIR --flavor NAME [OPTION]...

Options: (options can be presented in any order)

 --help         Display this output.
 --version      Display version and copyright information.
 --verbose      Show filenames that are being removed.
                         
 --kernel FILE  Path to the kernel you want to use.

 --modules DIR  Path to your kernel's modules directory.  These modules must be
                the ones that match your kernel.  
                
                For example, if the output from "uname -r" on a machine running
                the kernel in question is "2.4.19-4GB", then your modules
                directory would most likely be "/lib/modules/2.4.19-4GB".

 --flavor NAME  What do you want to call this new new boot package.

 --pre-net "MODULE1 MODULE2 etc..."
 
                List of modules to load before attempting to use the network.
                These modules will be placed in the initrd.img.  All other 
                modules will be included in the boel_binaries tarball.  You
                need not include any disk related drivers, unless they are
                needed to read a local.cfg file from the local floppy or hard
                disk drive(s).  
                
                A few non-network drivers are required at this stage, such as
                devfs and tmpfs, and must be available either as modules or
                compiled into your kernel.  You do not need to specify these
                here -- these modules will be copied over automatically if they
                exist.
