rsync configuration:
  VA SystemImager is heavily dependent on rsync.  For it to function properly,
  some configuration is necessary.  If your machine is not already configured
  to be an rsync server, you can just:
	cp -a /usr/share/doc/va-systemimager/examples/rsync /etc/init.d
	cp -a /usr/share/doc/va-systemimager/examples/rsyncd.conf /etc

  otherwise, you may need to edit these files by hand if you want to retain
  the functionality of your current rsync server configuration.

  This will probably become a debconf question in the future.
