Software RAID on Software RAID arrays are not currently supported.
    To be specific, what we mean is something like RAID level 10, for example,
    where you have two striped RAID 0 arrays, (/dev/md0 and /dev/md1), and you
    mirror them (RAID 1) for fault tolerance, and access the whole setup with 
    a third software RAID device (such as /dev/md2).  This particular setup
    could also be called RAID 0+1.

Filesystem specific settings are picked up from the golden client for FAT file 
    systems only.  For example, 12, 16, or 32 bit FAT is detected and properly
    re-created.  Look for this feature with other file systems in a future
    release.
