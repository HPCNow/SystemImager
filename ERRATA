o ext3 support
  o Known to work well with drivers version ext3-0.0.5c and newer.  May not
    work properly with earlier drivers.

  o SystemImager will use the default parameters to create an appropriately sized
    journal (given the size of the filesystem) stored internally in the filesystem.

    In the future, I hope to detect and re-create journals of an appropriate size.
    Currently we don't deal with non-hidden journals or journals on a device other
    than the filesystem device itself.

    If you different journal options, simply make the changes here in the.
    master autoinstall script.
