- makedhcpstatic:

  You will need to have the dhcp server re-read it's configuration
  file after running makedhcpstatic.  You can do this with the 
  following command or simply stop and re-start the dhcpd daemon.
  - killall -HUP dhcpd

- autoinstallclient:

  "Couldn't find this hosts name in /tmp/hosts!!!"  The version of
  sed changed in the autoinstall media in version 1.3.0. The 
  initialization scripts used POSIX statements to find any blank
  space (spaces or tabs).  The new sed binary didn't respond in the
  same way to these statements.  The result is that hosts files
  created by the addclients command (run automatically after getimage)
  are parsed properly.  Hand edited hosts files may not work properly.

- autoinstall clients with reiserfs root filesystems:

  lilo complains about a hole in a mapfile and will not make the disk
  bootable.  This is because the "notail" mount option is needed.

  This will be resolved in the next release.

  The hack for now is to edit your /tftpboot/systemimager/<imagename>.master 
  file, and add the options "-o notail" to the end of the mount command for
  your root filesystem (reiserfs only).

  The modified entry will look something like:

  #mount /dev/hda3 /a/
  mount /dev/hda3 /a/ -o notail

  Thanks to Matthew Marlowe for submitting this one.
