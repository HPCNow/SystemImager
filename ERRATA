Software RAID levels such as 10, or 50, (arrays of arrays) are currently not 
    supported.  
    
    To be specific, what we mean is something like RAID level 10, for example, 
    where you have two striped RAID 0 arrays, (/dev/md0 and /dev/md1), and you 
    mirror them (RAID 1) for fault tolerance, and access the whole setup with 
    a third software RAID device (such as /dev/md2).  This particular setup 
    is often called RAID 0+1, or RAID 10.

Filesystem specific settings are picked up from the golden client for FAT file 
    systems only.  For example, 12, 16, or 32 bit FAT is detected and properly
    re-created.  Look for this feature with other file systems in a future
    release.

"updateclient -a"
    SystemImager v1.5 used a "next boot" methodology with "updateclient -a"
    (or -autoinstall).  This meant that the client only attempted to boot the
    new SystemImager kernel once -- if it failed, it would fall back to booting
    the existing default kernel.  Due to boot loader complications related to
    the myriad of boot loaders now supported (via System Configurator), and the
    fact that System Configurator does not support modification of configuration
    files (only creating new ones), the "next boot" feature is not currently 
    supported.  It may be re-added at some point in the future.  If you desire
    this feature, please submit a feature request at
    http://systemimager.org/support.

pushupdate
    pushupdate passes options on to updateclient.  updateclient's options have
    changed, and pushupdate's options are currently out of sync.  Therefore, 
    pushupdate is not available in SystemImager v3.0.0, but will be put back in 
    in a bug fix release (perhaps 3.0.1).
